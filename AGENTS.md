# Epicenter

Local-first workspace platform. Monorepo with Yjs CRDTs and Svelte UI.

Structure: `apps/whispering/` (Tauri transcription app), `apps/tab-manager/` (Chrome extension), `apps/api/` (hosted personal Cloud Worker: `worker/` + `ui/`), `apps/self-host/` (self-hosted single-partition instance reference; Bun or Cloudflare), `packages/server/` (shared Hono library that both deployables consume; deployments differ by principal resolver), `packages/workspace/` (core TypeScript/Yjs library), `packages/cli/` (published CLI package and `epicenter` binary), `packages/ui/` (shadcn-svelte components), `specs/` (planning docs), `docs/` (reference materials).

Planning docs and decisions: Authoritative sources, in order, are `docs/adr/` (durable decisions and their rationale), `docs/CONTEXT.md` (shared vocabulary), and `docs/reference/` plus the code (current state). Specs in any `specs/` directory (top-level and per-app or per-package) are in-flight design scaffolding, not current truth; the two-state lifecycle and hygiene gate govern all of them repo-wide. `docs/spec-history.md` is a dated index of past specs and is history, not truth. When a spec conflicts with an ADR or the code, the ADR and code win. A spec has only two states, `Draft` and `In Progress`; "done" is deletion, not a terminal status, so a spec still in the tree declaring `Implemented`/`Superseded` is a hygiene smell (`scripts/check-doc-hygiene.ts` flags it). When a design pass settles a durable decision, record it as an ADR (see `docs/adr/README.md`) and delete the now-spent spec; git keeps the body recoverable.

Deployment seam: One library (`packages/server`), two deployables (`apps/api` = hosted personal cloud, `apps/self-host` = self-hosted single-partition instance reference). Multi-tenancy (many principals, OAuth, billing) is Cloud-only; an instance resolves every valid bearer to the literal `instance` principal (ADR-0075, amended by ADR-0092). Billing (catalog, routes, Autumn) lives in `apps/api/worker/billing/` and is hosted-only; never extract it back to a shared package. The self-hosted instance deployable is community-supported, not Epicenter-operated.

License boundary: apps and `packages/server` are AGPL; the embeddable toolkit packages are MIT (decision procedure in `docs/licensing/licensing-strategy.md`). Moving or copying code from an AGPL package into an MIT one is a relicensing act; `bun run check:licenses` guards dependency edges only and cannot see copied source.

Always use bun: Prefer `bun` over npm, yarn, pnpm, and node. Use `bun run`, `bun test`, `bun install`, and `bun x` (instead of npx).

Local dev: start apps from the repo root with `bun dev:<app>`; it runs every process the app needs, including the hosted API on `localhost:8787` for apps that talk to it. `bun dev:<app>:ui` is the frontend alone when that split exists; `bun dev:api` is the backend alone. Do not cd into an app to start it. Details in the `monorepo` skill.

Agent instruction files: Treat `AGENTS.md` as the canonical shared instructions file. `CLAUDE.md` files are compatibility shims for Claude Code and should only import a sibling `AGENTS.md` with `@AGENTS.md`, plus rare Claude-specific notes if needed. When adding a nested `AGENTS.md`, add a sibling `CLAUDE.md` shim. Do not create orphan `CLAUDE.md` files.

Destructive actions need approval: Force pushes, hard resets (`--hard`), branch deletions.

External grounding: When external library behavior affects correctness, verify against DeepWiki, official docs, or local installed types before changing code. Skip this for stable basics and repo-local patterns already documented in skills.

Git hygiene: Stage specific files only. Never use `git add .` or `git add -A`. Do not include AI or tool attribution in commits.

Review posture: Be direct about flawed assumptions, weak designs, and regressions. Do not agree just to be agreeable.

Script suffix convention: `:local` suffix scripts work on a fresh clone without Infisical login (they read committed config like `wrangler.jsonc`). `:remote` suffix scripts wrap with `infisical run --env=prod` and require Infisical authentication; treat them as production admin operations.

Library logging: Do not use direct `console.*` in library code. Use `wellcrafted/logger`, except in CLIs, tests, and benchmarks.

Writing conventions: Load `writing-voice` skill for any user-facing text or punctuation-sensitive prose (UI strings, tooltips, error messages, docs, comments, JSDoc, markdown, and commit messages). Default to colon, comma, semicolon, parenthesis, or sentence break over em dash characters (`U+2014`), especially in UI strings. Do not use en dash characters (`U+2013`).

Review gates: For substantial implementations, public API changes, refactors, multi-file changes, or user requests to challenge, simplify, clean up, greenfield, or make a clean break, load `post-implementation-review` before final handoff or staging. Load `collapse-pass` directly for continuous indirection-reduction work. During review, escalate to `greenfield-clean-breaks` for ownership, lifecycle, API, package-boundary, clean-break, compatibility-refusal, or asymmetric-win decisions. After a substantive multi-file wave, consider `fresh-context-review` when an independent challenge could catch ownership, lifecycle, or type-shape mistakes; it delegates review, never execution. Keep procedures in skills; keep `AGENTS.md` to routing.
