# 0088. The blob store is a presigned-S3 kernel and the bucket is its only index

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-07-01

## Context

Epicenter needs a home for bytes too large for git or a Yjs doc (media, archives, exports). Worker request-body caps are edge-enforced, so bytes must not transit the Worker; R2 enforces a whole-object `x-amz-checksum-sha256` only on a single PutObject, so multipart uploads cannot carry content addressing; and a Workers-native `R2Bucket` binding is a runtime lock-in that a SigV4 presigned URL is not. A previous blob subsystem was deleted in January 2026 for having no consumers, so the surface must stay minimal.

## Decision

Blobs live in one S3-compatible bucket under owner-scoped content-addressed keys, `owners/<ownerId>/blobs/<sha256>`, and the bucket is the store's only state. The server (`packages/server/src/s3-blob-store.ts`, `routes/blobs.ts`) mints a presigned single PUT with the base64 checksum and content type pinned into the signature (the client echoes them verbatim; the store rejects bytes that do not match their address), and answers reads with a 302 to a short-TTL presigned GET. There is no blob database, no queue, no confirm endpoint: the object appearing under its hash is the record of a successful upload, and listing is a signed `ListObjectsV2`. Everything is standard SigV4 (`aws4fetch`), so the same code runs against R2, MinIO, Garage, or S3 from a Worker or a Bun process.

## Consequences

Dedupe is a HEAD on the owner-scoped key, so re-uploading identical bytes is free and idempotent within one owner; content is deliberately never addressed across owners (a cross-owner store would be an equality oracle). The 5 GiB single-PUT ceiling is the integrity contract, not a temporary limit: multipart is refused because its composite checksum breaks content addressing. Usage is computed by list-and-sum until real metering lands. The store never learns whether bytes are plaintext or ciphertext (see ADR-0089).

## Considered alternatives

- `R2Bucket` binding: Workers-only API, and the body cap forces multipart, which forfeits store-enforced content addressing.
- A blob table beside the bucket: two sources of truth that drift; the bucket already answers every query the system asks.
- An upload-confirm endpoint: redundant; the object under its hash is the confirmation.
