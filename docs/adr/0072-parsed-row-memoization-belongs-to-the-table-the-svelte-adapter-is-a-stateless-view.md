# 0072. Parsed-row memoization belongs to the table; the Svelte adapter is a stateless view

- **Status:** Accepted
- **Date:** 2026-06-27

## Context

`fromTable` (in `@epicenter/svelte`) adapts a workspace `Table` into reactive
Svelte state. Today it seeds a `SvelteMap`, keeps it in sync by re-reading each
changed id on `observe()`, attaches the `nonconforming` / `newerWriter` buckets
with `Object.defineProperties`, and exposes `[Symbol.dispose]()` that every
consumer state module threads upward.

Grounding the design against Svelte 5 source (v5.56.3) and `table.ts` overturned
the assumption that justified that shape:

- A `SvelteMap`'s list reads (`values()`, iteration) are **coarse**: `#read_all`
  reads `#version`, which increments on any add, delete, or value-replace. Every
  list view (`active`, `deleted`, `all`) re-runs on any row change. The map's
  only fine-grained surface is the per-key `get(id)`.
- So the `SvelteMap` was never really a reactivity structure. It was an
  **incremental parsed-row cache** living in the UI framework: it re-parsed only
  changed rows on `observe()` (`table.get(id)`) and preserved the object identity
  of unchanged rows. That is what forced the `[Symbol.dispose]()` ceremony, and
  what made a lazy `createSubscriber` lifecycle impossible (an unread cache goes
  stale).
- `table.scan()` is not cached: it re-parses every stored entry (TypeBox
  `Value.Check` + `migrate`) and returns fresh row objects on every call.
- `YKeyValueLww` holds one entry object per key in `_map` and only replaces it
  when that key changes, so the stored value is a **stable object reference**
  for unchanged rows. A cache keyed by that reference can be both incremental and
  identity-preserving.

Parse cost and row-object identity are table concerns, not Svelte concerns.
Binding them to a framework object is the wrong layer: it duplicates rows,
excludes non-Svelte consumers (materializers, CLI scripts, `findValid`, direct
`scan()` callers), and leaks lifecycle into every consumer.

## Decision

Split the two concerns by layer.

- The **Svelte adapter is a stateless view**. `fromTable` holds no mirror. It
  reads live through the table behind a single `createSubscriber`, exposing
  `all`, `nonconforming`, `newerWriter` (one shared `$derived` over `scan()`),
  and `byId(id)`. No `SvelteMap`, no `Object.defineProperties`, no
  `[Symbol.dispose]`: `createSubscriber` starts the observer while an effect
  reads and tears it down when none do.
- **Parsed-row memoization and identity stability live in `createReadonlyTable`.**
  `parseRow` is memoized by the stored value's object reference (a
  `WeakMap<storedValue, Result>`), so `scan()` and `get()` reparse only changed
  rows and return the same row object for an unchanged row across calls. `scan()`
  stays the public classified-read surface from [ADR-0001](0001-classified-scan-read-surface.md);
  the cache sits behind it.

Reactivity granularity is the adapter's job; parse memoization and row identity
are the table's job.

## Consequences

- `fromTable` collapses to a stateless view and the dispose ceremony disappears
  from every consumer. Consumers move from the `SvelteMap` shape (`values()`,
  `size`, `get`, `has`, `keys`) to `{ all, byId, has, allIds, nonconforming,
  newerWriter }`. This is a wide but mechanical, compile-checked migration.
- The expensive cost (parsing) and the identity-churn risk that a stateless
  adapter would otherwise introduce are both solved once, in the table, for every
  consumer, not just Svelte. Without the cache, a stateless adapter would re-parse
  all rows and hand out fresh row objects on every change, churning keyed child
  props and identity-keyed deriveds. The cache must ship with the adapter change,
  not after it.
- The adapter loses the map's one fine-grained surface: `byId` re-runs on any
  table change, where the old `map.get(id)` re-ran only when that id changed.
  Acceptable below ~10k rows at human-speed edits; the named seam to restore it
  is a per-id `createSubscriber` keyed by id, added only under profiler evidence.
- The table cache assumes `YKeyValueLww` keeps a stable stored-value reference
  for unchanged rows (true today). If that invariant ever changes, the cache
  silently degrades to full re-parse rather than breaking correctness.
- `scan()`'s contract is unchanged; callers outside Svelte transparently get the
  incremental parse and stable identities.
