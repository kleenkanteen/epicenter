# Account and Document Scope

This is the canonical reference for which principal scopes a document in Epicenter,
how cloud sync is addressed, and where "organization" fits. For the narrative behind the
decision, see `docs/articles/20260522T170000-documents-belong-to-you-not-a-workspace.md`.

## The core rule

A document is scoped to an authenticated principal. There is no container between
that principal and the document.

```
principal = a Better Auth user in Cloud, or the literal "instance" on self-host
document  = a Y.Doc, identified by its guid
```

The token says which principal the request represents. For documents under that
principal, that is the entire authorization story. There is no membership lookup,
because the route does not echo or select another principal.

## Three layers, introduced over time

Epicenter separates content ownership from tenancy and billing. They are
distinct layers; only Layer 1 exists today.

```
LAYER 3  Tenancy / billing       acme.com, 40 seats, admin console     Google Workspace
           groups user ACCOUNTS for one invoice and admin policy       (enterprise, future)
              |  administers
LAYER 2  Shared-drive content    docs OWNED BY an org, so they         Google Shared Drives
           survive a departing employee                                (enterprise, future)
              |  alongside
LAYER 1  Principal content       principals/<principalId> scopes        consumer Google Docs
           the doc; sharing is not built yet                             (TODAY)
```

Layer 1 is what ships today: documents sit under the resolved principal. Layer
1.5 is per-document sharing through an access list, additive, not yet built.
Layer 2 is org-owned
content for the enterprise case where work must outlive an employee. Layer 3 is
the billing and administration grouping for enterprise seats.

The layers attach cleanly because Layer 1 makes no claim about teams or billing.
Build a fused container first (the Notion model) and you are forced to invent a
container-of-one for every solo user before any real org exists.

## Google Docs, not Notion

The distinction that decides everything: Notion fuses content ownership and
billing into one "workspace". A page lives inside a workspace, the workspace is
the billing boundary, membership is workspace-level. One entity, two jobs.

Google separates them. A Google Doc is owned by a user account; sharing is a
per-document access list. Google Workspace is a separate product: a domain, an
admin console, per-seat billing, administering a set of user accounts. It never
owns a document.

Epicenter follows Google. Content scope is Layer 1. Tenancy and billing are
Layer 3. They never merge.

## Cloud sync addressing

A cloud doc syncs through one route, keyed by the authenticated principal and
the doc's guid.

```
route     /api/rooms/:room                          (all deployments)
DO name   principals/${principalId}/rooms/${room}    (room = ydoc.guid)
builder   roomWsUrl({ baseURL, guid: ydoc.guid, nodeId })
```

The DO partition is `principals/<principalId>` in every deployment. In Cloud,
the principal is derived from the authenticated user. On a self-hosted
instance, `principalId === 'instance'`, so every operator-authorized request on
the deployment shares the same partition. The room id is the Y.Doc's guid: the
document already carries its own identity, so nothing else is
composed into the name.

Browser apps and the daemon use the same route and the same builder. They sync
the same document by using the same guid.

There is no `appId` segment. A user may hold documents from several apps;
cross-app collision is avoided by convention (each app names its root doc
after itself, child docs carry unique guids), not by infrastructure. Guid
uniqueness per user is already required for local IndexedDB, so cloud sync
adds no new collision surface.

## What "organization" means here

An organization is a Layer 3 concept: a billing and administration grouping of
user accounts. It is not a container that owns documents.

The Better Auth organization plugin belongs to Layer 3, where its real strengths
(members, roles, invitations, admin) apply to accounts. It does not belong under
documents. A solo user is not an organization, and modeling them as an
organization-of-one buys a degenerate entity, a derived id that is a pure hash
of the user id, and a membership check whose only failure mode is a provisioning
bug.

## Why personal docs need no membership check

Authorization for a Layer 1 document is principal resolution, not membership.
The auth middleware confirms the caller is a valid principal; the DO name is
derived from that same principal. A request reaching
`principals/${principalId}/rooms/*` is, by construction, scoped to the principal
that auth resolved. A membership query here would have exactly one possible
denial: the system is broken.

Layer 1.5 sharing changes this only for documents shared *to* you: the source
principal's DO name stays `principals/${principalId}/rooms/${room}`, and an ACL
table grants other principals access. The auth check becomes "is the caller the
source principal, or in the ACL". Your own documents still need no lookup.

## Billing

Billing is per user account. The signup hook creates an Autumn customer keyed on
`user.id`. No per-document or per-workspace billing exists. Enterprise per-seat
billing is Layer 3 and aggregates user accounts under a tenancy; it does not
require content to be owned by anything other than the user.
