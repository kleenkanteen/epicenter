# Context: shared vocabulary

The words Epicenter uses for its own concepts, so humans and agents name the same
thing the same way. Keep entries to one or two lines. When a design pass coins or
sharpens a term, update it here in the same change. For the decisions behind these
shapes, see `docs/adr/`.

## Platform and topology

- **Workspace**: a Y.Doc that is at once a sync room and an access-policy atom. The
  unit apps compose; an app may compose several workspaces.
- **Room**: the server side of a workspace. One Cloudflare Durable Object with an
  embedded SQLite `updates` table.
- **Star**: the one runnable program that holds your data, composing anchor,
  store, sync, and identity/auth into a deployment (ADR-0069). The star is the
  unit of self-host and the entire privacy question: Epicenter runs it (hosted)
  or you run it (self-host). Distinct from a **service you call** (inference,
  blob URLs): a service is addressed by `{baseUrl, token?}`, sees only the one
  payload you hand it, and is never part of the star's topology. "Single-user /
  sovereign" is a preset over the star's credential source and principal
  resolver, not a mode (ADR-0070, amended by ADR-0092).
- **Anchor**: the always-on node that *holds* a workspace's Y.Doc so a sleeping
  device can catch up. Who runs the anchor is the whole privacy question (ADR-0068):
  user-run gives topology privacy, Epicenter-run is trusted plaintext. Privacy moves
  by relocating the anchor, never by a setting in the app.
- **Relay**: moves bytes between a person's devices when they cannot reach each
  other directly, then forgets. Blind to content in principle. *Fused with the anchor
  today*: the hosted relay is one Cloudflare Durable Object that also holds and reads
  your plaintext (ADR-0035); separating the relay role from the anchor (ADR-0035) would
  let a blind relay route to an anchor you hold.
- **Store**: the anchor's app-blind sibling for big binaries (audio, images),
  `put` / `get` / `has` by reference; the doc carries the reference, never the bytes
  (ADR-0035). Any S3-compatible endpoint (versitygw for dev, Garage for self-host).
- **Trusted relay**: the server reads workspace plaintext. Zero-knowledge was
  evaluated and rejected; the encryption layer was removed (ADR-0004).
- **Node roles**: four distinct roles, separable even when one machine plays
  several (ADR-0049): *client* runs the agent loop and binds the others;
  *inference server* turns a prompt into tokens; *daemon* holds data and runs
  dispatched tools but never infers; *relay/anchor* is content-blind coordination
  and never infers.
- **Inference server**: the only node role that infers (ADR-0049). One stateless
  turn per request: given a prompt plus a tool catalog it streams tokens, returns
  the model's tool calls, and stops, leaving the client loop to execute them
  (ADR-0047). It sees the prompt and tools as accepted egress to the model
  (ADR-0033), so it is *not* content-blind, unlike the relay, but it owns no loop,
  tool, or transcript. The wire is OpenAI-compatible (ADR-0050), so the box is
  swappable by base URL: Epicenter's metered gateway (house key, billed; it never
  accepts a provider key), a self-hosted gateway (your key or a local model), or
  any third-party OpenAI-compatible endpoint. A BYOK key is handed to a custom
  inference server (self-hosted or local), never to the Epicenter gateway or a
  daemon (ADR-0054).
- **Deployable vs library**: one library, `packages/server`, consumed by two
  deployables: `apps/api` (hosted personal cloud) and `apps/self-host` (the
  community single-partition instance reference, not Epicenter-operated; ADR-0075).
- **Principal**: the authenticated identity Epicenter uses as the partition key
  (ADR-0092). Cloud resolves many principals from Better Auth users; a
  self-hosted instance resolves every valid operator bearer to the literal
  `instance` principal. Durable namespaces use `principals/<principalId>/...`.
  Billing is hosted-only and lives in `apps/api/worker/billing/`.
- **Cross-device planes**: cross-device work splits by responsibility. *Inference* (the
  chat brain) streams tokens from an OpenAI-compatible endpoint (ADR-0050),
  over the inference seam. *Sync* (convergent state) carries document history
  over the relay, and server-owned presence reports which workspace peers are
  online. *Invoke* (the agent's hands) is local to the host that owns the tool
  process, unless a future product re-earns a direct URL-addressed box surface.
- **Infisical project**: the owner and access-control boundary. Each secret-using
  runnable surface owns its own `.infisical.json`: `apps/api` and `ops` point
  at Epicenter's hosted/operator project, and personal local apps use ignored
  app-local configs that point at the operator's personal project. The ignored
  configs are per-person bring-your-own provider setup; the committed configs
  are shared Epicenter infrastructure.
- **Infisical environment**: a value-stakes tier inside a project, not an
  owner. In the Epicenter project, `dev` holds substitute values that can hurt
  nothing (the local `wrangler dev` bindings) and `prod` holds hosted
  production/operator credentials. In a personal local-app project, `prod`
  holds the real provider credentials for the person running the tool. The path
  groups by app or surface (`/api`, `/ci`, `/ops`, `/apps/<app>`). The provider
  target rides in the qualified secret name (ADR-0108), never in the
  environment. The monorepo root has no Infisical config, so local apps cannot
  silently inherit Epicenter's hosted/operator project.

## Workspace API

- **`defineTable` / `defineKv`**: schema builders for a workspace's tables and
  key-value store.
- **`satisfiesWorkspace`**: the bundle-conformance helper (renamed from the older
  `defineWorkspaceBundle`).
- **Actions and collaboration**: actions live on the workspace bundle;
  collaboration is sync and presence only.
- **`scan()`**: the single bulk table read. Returns three buckets, conforming,
  nonconforming, and newer-writer, plus point probes. The valid-only read family
  (`getAllValid`, `getAllInvalid`, `getAll`, `conformance`, `filter`) was deleted.
- **`_v`**: the per-row schema version tuple; conformance is judged against it.
- **Conformance**: whether a stored row matches the current schema. Nonconforming
  rows surface in `scan()`, never silently dropped.
- **Child doc**: a separate Y.Doc per row field (for example a transcript), reached
  through `ws.tables.X.docs.field.open(rowId)`. The workspace owns guid derivation.
- **Worker**: running behavior that observes workspace state and writes results
  back. Workers may be local (every node runs them) or agent-bound (one
  configured agent answers). A conversation is answered by the client agent loop
  in the open tab, for every agent (ADR-0047); the daemon contributes data and
  side effects as dispatched actions (tools), never by running the loop.
- **Agent**: the durable address a row or conversation binds to (an immutable
  id). An agent names who should answer; the peer that answers as it is the
  client tab or a daemon, set by the agent's **trust location** (ADR-0030/0043).
- **Trust location**: where an agent's data and tools live, and therefore where
  its side effects run (ADR-0030, ADR-0047). The reasoning loop always runs in
  the client, which drives an inference server (ADR-0049); what varies is the
  agent's capability. A **capability-free** agent (Vocab) has no tools. A
  **local-data** agent (Local Books) keeps its data and action handlers on the
  user's own always-on daemon, which the client loop reaches by dispatching
  actions; data leaves the daemon only as a tool result. The relay is
  content-blind; the inference server is a stateless turn that sees the prompt as
  accepted egress (not content-blind). Trust is per-agent, not global.
- **Conversation loop**: the client-side loop that answers every conversation,
  streams the live turn into a snapshot the UI renders, and persists finished
  messages as records (ADR-0047). It replaces the older doc-observing *answerer*
  (a daemon that wrote the reply into the doc), which ADR-0047 removed. Two
  implementations exist, chosen by transcript reach (ADR-0048): a transcript that
  syncs across a person's peers uses the workspace loop (`createConversation`,
  finished messages in a Yjs child doc); a deliberately device-local transcript
  uses TanStack `createChat` (tab-manager, IndexedDB).
- **Materializer**: a local, addressless worker that projects workspace data into
  another store (markdown, sqlite).
- **`attach*` vs `create*`**: `attach*` are side-effectful primitives that register
  listeners at call time; `create*` are pure construction.

## App composition

- **`create<App>`**: the isomorphic doc factory for an app.
- **`open<App>Browser` / `open<App>Extension` / tauri**: environment factories.
- **`#platform/*`**: the build-time platform DI seam for multi-platform (Tauri) apps.
- **`session`**: the singleton holding the signed-in workspace lifecycle.
- **deviceConfig vs workspace KV**: per-device settings (global shortcuts, machine
  collisions) versus synced settings (local shortcuts). The asymmetry is deliberate.
- **Vault**: the designated, not-yet-built home for the one encryption that
  survives ADR-0004: an explicitly encrypted, shared workspace for secrets only
  (blind relay, Argon2-derived key). Its primitives were removed with the
  encryption layer; it returns minimally if a secrets path is built. Distinct
  from the Matter vault (a folder of Markdown).

## CLI and daemon

- **Epicenter root**: a directory whose `epicenter.config.ts` declares one mount.
  Discovery walks up to the nearest one. One root, one daemon.
- **Daemon**: the long-lived foreground process started by `epicenter daemon up`.
  It opens the root's mount, owns the lease, joins sync when signed in, and keeps
  materializers alive. It is not a callable action server.
- **Peer**: a device currently connected to the same workspace room. Presence is
  server-owned and surfaced by app UI or watcher logs, not a generic CLI query.
- **Daemon lifecycle commands**: `daemon up`, `daemon down`, `daemon ps`, and
  `daemon logs`. They use metadata, pid liveness, logs, and OS signals. No Unix
  socket or daemon action client exists.
- **Library script**: a `bun ./script.ts` that reads materialized SQLite or
  Markdown directly. Generic off-process writes are deliberately absent; real
  write workflows should earn an app-specific command or in-process script.
