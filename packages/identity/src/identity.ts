 * instance it is the literal 'instance'. Every server path, every R2 key, every
 * local IDB name, and the HKDF derivation label all use this one value.
 *
 * Deployment shape (`perUser` vs instance) is never carried as its own field: it
 * is a property of the server, not of any cell or wire payload. This is the
 * canonical site for the rare consumer that genuinely must distinguish them:
 * derive it as `ownerId === INSTANCE_OWNER_ID` (instance) versus
 * `ownerId === userId` (`perUser`). Most code should not branch at all and just
 * use `ownerId` as the opaque partition key.
 *
 * The validator is declared first; the type is derived from it via `.infer`
 * so schema and type stay in lockstep under one PascalCase name. Use
 * {@link OwnerId} directly inside schemas (`ownerId: OwnerId`); at trusted
 * call sites brand a known `string` via {@link asOwnerId}.
