 * `AccountPopover`'s `disabledReason`, so a reload can never fire mid-action.
 *
 * @param options.callbackPath - The app's OAuth callback route. A sign-in
 * completing there fires this state change before the page's own redirect can
 * run; a bare reload would land back on the callback URL and replay the
 * already-consumed authorization code, surfacing a spurious error after a
 * real success, so that one location gets `replace('/')` instead.
