/**
 * Relay-channel wire protocol: the text frames that multiplex named
 * request/response channels over the account-room WebSocket each device already
 * holds (the [collapse spec]'s relay floor). They share that one authenticated
 * socket with Yjs sync (binary frames) and presence, but are independent at the
 * protocol level: the relay forwards a channel's bytes BLIND and never parses
 * the MCP (or HTTP) payload inside.
 *
 * Frame flow (all text frames on the one socket; `id` is the caller-minted
 * channel correlation id, echoed unchanged; the relay routes by it and forwards
 * everything but the open verbatim):
 *
 *   caller -> relay -> target : `channel_open`   (open a channel to `target`/`route`)
 *   target -> relay -> caller : `channel_accept` (route admitted, target alive)
 *   either <-> relay <-> other: `channel_data`   (an opaque base64 byte chunk)
 *   either <-> relay <-> other: `channel_reset`  (the terminal frame, both directions)
 *
 * Terminal flow is RESET-ONLY: there is no half-close `channel_end`. The one
 * consumer (an MCP session) only closes the whole session, so a single
 * `channel_reset` carries the terminal signal both ways, `closed` meaning a clean
 * end and any other code an error. This also keeps teardown deterministic and the
 * relay's channel entry from lingering (closing a writable always emits the reset;
 * a half-close that relied on `ReadableStream.cancel()` did not).
 *
 * Browser-safe: pure TypeBox schemas, no node builtin, so the client transport
 * (`packages/workspace/src/relay-channel/`) and the server router
 * (`packages/server/src/room/channel-router.ts`) share one source of truth. It
 * replaces the former in-room dispatch protocol, which routed `action`/`input`
 * and a typed `Result` the relay had to understand; this one is a dumb byte
 * pipe.
 *
 * Minimal on purpose: `channel_data.bytes` is the whole payload (no `seq`, since
 * one ordered WebSocket preserves order end to end), and the caller's open
 * carries no `source`: the relay stamps an unforgeable one it authenticated, and
 * the acceptor authorizes by it (see {@link ChannelSourceSchema}).
