/**
 * The cross-device transport seam.
 *
 * A {@link PeerTransport} opens a raw byte channel to a named route on a remote
 * peer. It is the ONLY thing the cross-device tool layer (the agent loop's
 * MCP-client `ToolCatalog` arm) sees: it never learns how the bytes travel, only
 * that they reach the named route.
 *
 * One implementation sits behind this seam today, the relay-channel
 * ({@link ./relay-channel/transport.createRelayChannelTransport}): the universal
 * floor, a channel multiplexed on the principal account-room WebSocket, so it
 * works in any browser with no app, server-mediated over the device's existing
 * sync connection. The seam stays an interface so the MCP `ToolCatalog` consumer
 * (`agent/mcp-gateway-catalog.ts`) never imports the relay-channel implementation
 * or learns how a route is reached, only that the bytes arrive: it is the
 * browser-safe boundary between the tool layer and the transport.
 *
 * The seam is the {@link ByteChannel}, intentionally runtime-portable (Web
 * Streams, not node streams) so the same seam serves a browser and a node daemon.
 *
 * A *peer* is the unit that is dialed: a device authenticated to the relay as a
 * principal. The relay routes by the target's nodeId and stamps an unforgeable
 * `source` on every channel, so a peer reaches another same-principal device
 * with no key exchange in between.
