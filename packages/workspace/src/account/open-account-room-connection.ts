/**
 * Open the per-person account room as a relay-floor connection. Browser-safe.
 *
 * The account room is the per-user fleet room: an ordinary sync room at the
 * reserved guid {@link RESERVED_ACCOUNT_ROOM_GUID}, so every device a person
 * runs (the daemon, a browser tab) joins the SAME room and can route typed
 * channels to one another over the one socket each already holds. This is the
 * relay floor's home. The channel router
 * (`packages/server/src/room/channel-router.ts`) runs in every room and
 * forwards a channel only among same-owner sockets sharing that room; what
 * makes the account room the floor is not extra capability but the guarantee
 * of rendezvous: it is the one room every signed-in device is always in, so a
 * caller can reach any online device here without knowing which workspace
 * rooms it happens to hold open.
 *
 * This module is the browser-safe core that both ends share: the daemon's
 * {@link ../daemon/open-account-room.openAccountRoom} resolves node-only config
 * (the durable node id off disk, the daemon's sync base URL) and the
 * `clientId` it pins, then delegates here; a browser passes `{ ...signedIn,
 * nodeId }` straight in. Keeping one definition of "what an account-room
 * connection is" is why this is extracted rather than forked.
 *
 * It pulls no node builtin: `openCollaboration`, `roomWsUrl`, and
 * `createChannelPort` are all browser-safe, and the deterministic Y.Doc
 * `clientID` (the one node-only piece, hashed with `node:crypto`) is passed in
 * as an optional number rather than computed here.
