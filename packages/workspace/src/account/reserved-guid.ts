/**
 * The reserved guid of the principal account room.
 *
 * The account room (the principal fleet room the relay floor rides) is not a new
 * Durable Object type: it is an ordinary sync room opened at
 * `/api/rooms/<RESERVED_ACCOUNT_ROOM_GUID>`, so it reuses every bit of room
 * machinery (bearer auth, Y.Doc sync, the WebSocket upgrade). Auth selects the
 * `principals/<principalId>` partition server-side. What makes it safe to
 * reserve a fixed guid is that it cannot collide with any guid a user workspace
 * mints:
 *
 *   - A workspace ROOT guid is a single {@link assertSafeSegment} segment, so it
 *     contains no dot (`epicenter-fuji`).
 *   - A content-doc guid is exactly four dotted segments
 *     (`workspace.collection.row.field`, see `document/doc-guid.ts`).
 *
 * This guid is two dotted segments (`epicenter.account`), a shape neither
 * minting path can ever produce. Each segment still passes the safe-segment
 * grammar (validated below at module load), so the guid is safe in every sink a
 * guid feeds (URL path, on-disk `<guid>.db`, IndexedDB store). The relay itself
 * is guid-grammar-blind: Hono treats `.` as a literal and a single `:roomId`
 * param captures the whole dotted id, so a dotted guid round-trips the route
 * unchanged (`rooms-route-pattern.test.ts`).
