/**
 * Compose several {@link ToolCatalog}s into one the agent loop consumes
 * unchanged. The loop is handed a single catalog; an app that reaches tools more
 * than one way merges them here.
 *
 * Collision rule: first-wins. A tool name that appears in more than one catalog
 * is owned by the EARLIEST catalog in the list, for both the offered definition
 * and the `resolve` that runs it. Pass the local in-process catalog first so a
 * local action shadows a same-named remote tool.
 *
 * The source may be a live getter: `definitions()` and `resolve()` re-read it on
 * every call, so an app that mounts or unmounts a device's catalog over time
 * passes `() => [local, ...mounted]` and the merged surface tracks the change
 * with no re-wiring of the loop.
