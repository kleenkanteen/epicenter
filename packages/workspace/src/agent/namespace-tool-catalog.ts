/**
 * Wrap a {@link ToolCatalog} so every tool name is prefixed, keeping two
 * sources' same-named tools distinct in a composed surface.
 *
 * Cross-device tools auto-mount one catalog per (device, route) over the relay
 * floor. Two devices that both serve `local-books` expose a tool literally named
 * `customers`; merged under {@link composeToolCatalogs}'s first-wins rule, the
 * second would vanish and every `customers` call would route to the first.
 * Prefixing each device's tools (`<deviceKey>__customers`) makes them coexist:
 * the model sees distinct names, and `resolve` strips the prefix before
 * delegating. The local in-process catalog stays UNprefixed, so its names are the
 * plain ones the app's own tools have always had.
 *
 * The prefix must not itself contain the `__` separator (the caller derives it
 * from a sanitized id), but the underlying tool name may: `resolve` slices by the
 * known prefix length, never by searching for `__`.
