/**
 * Resolve a daemon's durable node identity for one Epicenter root.
 *
 * The daemon's identity is a durable nanoid persisted under `runtimeDir()`: the
 * same id file always yields the same NodeId, so a restart reuses the identity,
 * two folders on one machine get distinct ids (distinct files, keyed by dir
 * hash), and two machines never collide (the id is minted randomly on first
 * boot). The file lives under `runtimeDir()` (machine-local, OUTSIDE the repo
 * tree), not under `.epicenter/`, so it survives `git clean` and is never
 * accidentally committed.
 *
 * The NodeId is the relay's routing label (stamped on the room WebSocket as
 * `?nodeId=`) and the seed for the Y.Doc CRDT `clientID` via
 * `hashYDocClientId(nodeId)`. It is a plain claimed id, not a signing key: the
 * relay floor authenticates by the session's `principalId`, never the nodeId.
 *
 * Browser app nodeIds (opensidian, fuji, honeycrisp, vocab, tab-manager) are the
 * same kind of nanoid, persisted in Web Storage via `createNodeId` /
 * `createNodeIdAsync` in `document/node-id.ts`. This module only differs in
 * where the daemon persists its own: under the runtime dir instead of storage.
