/**
 * Wire the device's relay-floor acceptor: accept inbound relay channels over the
 * account-room socket and serve them from the daemon's route table. It is the
 * device's accept loop, riding the connection the account room already holds.
 *
 * The endpoint gate (the caller must be this principal, the route must be
 * explicitly `relay: 'exposed'`) lives in {@link createRelayRouteOpener}; the acceptor is
 * pure mechanism. By default the route table exposes NOTHING over the relay (the
 * `books` route is `refused`), so this is safe to wire unconditionally: the
 * device participates in the floor but admits a route only once one opts in.
 *
 * NODE-ONLY: the route opener spawns route children.
