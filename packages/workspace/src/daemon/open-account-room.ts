/**
 * Open the principal account room on the daemon: the relay floor's home.
 *
 * The account room is the per-principal fleet room: an ordinary sync room at the
 * reserved guid, so it reuses every bit of room machinery (bearer auth, Y.Doc
 * sync, the WebSocket upgrade) the same way a mount's room does. `epicenter
 * daemon up` opens it alongside its mount and rides the relay floor over the one
 * connection it holds: the channel port carries cross-device tool channels, and
 * server-owned presence lists this user's other online devices.
 *
 * What this node module owns is the node-only glue the browser-safe core cannot
 * do: resolve the durable node id off disk, resolve the daemon's sync base URL,
 * and pin a deterministic Y.Doc clientID with `node:crypto`. The room itself
 * (Y.Doc at the reserved guid, sync, the channel port) is the shared
 * {@link openAccountRoomConnection} core a browser uses the same way. There is no
 * per-device signing or trust ledger; the relay floor authenticates by the
 * session's `principalId`, and a route is reached on principal identity plus a
 * relay-exposed gate (see `gateway/relay-route.ts`).
 *
 * It is gated on a signed-in session: the room is bearer-authed, so a signed-out
 * daemon has no account room (it returns `null`, the room's analogue of an
 * inactive mount). The daemon treats opening it as best-effort: a failure here
 * never aborts the mount that is the daemon's actual job.
