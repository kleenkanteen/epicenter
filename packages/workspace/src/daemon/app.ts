/**
 * Hono app for the `epicenter daemon up` daemon. Single source of truth for the
 * routes; the daemon server wires its fetch handler into Bun's listener and
 * the hand-rolled `daemonClient` in `./client.ts` POSTs against it.
 *
 * Each route is a one-line shell shortcut for one daemon runtime primitive:
 *
 *   /peers  ->  collaboration.peers.list()
 *   /list   ->  mount label + bare action manifest
 *   /run    ->  invokeAction(...) against this daemon's registry
 *
 * Each route returns the handler's `Result<T, DomainErr>` body directly.
 * Unexpected exceptions propagate to Hono's default error handler (HTTP
 * 500), which the client maps to `DaemonError.HandlerCrashed`. There is
 * no second on-the-wire envelope: `Result<Result<...>, ...>` is gone.
