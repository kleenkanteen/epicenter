/**
 * `openCollaboration`: the one collaboration primitive on a document.
 *
 * Connects a Yjs document to the relay and derives per-peer liveness from the
 * server-owned presence channel. An additive text-frame port (`textPort`) lets
 * the relay-channel layer ride the same socket for cross-device MCP channels
 * without coupling to sync or presence.
 *
 * Two wire surfaces ride one auth context:
 *
 *   binary WS frames  -> standard y-protocols SYNC.
 *   text WS frames    -> server -> client: presence (the full peer list, sent on
 *                        every membership change);
 *                        client -> server: presence_publish (this node's
 *                        identity: agent designation and exposed route names),
 *                        sent once per connect.
 *
 * The Y.Doc holds durable workspace state; presence lives on the relay's
 * `connections` map.
 *
 * Content docs (rich-text bodies, attachments, nested independently-syncing
 * docs) use the same primitive with `actions: {}` as a local empty registry;
 * presence still flows in over the socket for online discovery.
