 * broadcasts the FULL peer list on every membership change. The client stores
 * the latest list verbatim: there is no delta protocol and no client-side
 * reassembly, the frame IS the state.
 *
 * The `actions` manifest field is decommissioned: it is retained on the wire
 * (always `{}`) for version-skew safety now that the in-room dispatch subsystem
 * is deleted (ADR-0073), but nothing reads it. The live presence payload is each
 * peer's `nodeId`, `connectedAt`, `agentId`, and `exposedRoutes`.
 *
 * Shared by the relay (`packages/server/src/room/core.ts`, the sender) and
 * the client (`open-collaboration.ts`, the reader).
 *
 * Schemas are TypeBox: they ARE valid JSON Schema at runtime, double as the
 * source of truth for the TypeScript types via `Static`, and feed
 * `typebox/compile`'s `Compile()` to produce checked-once validators reused
 * at every boundary. No hand-written duck-typing helpers.
