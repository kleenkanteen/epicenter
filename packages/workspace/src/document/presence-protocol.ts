/**
 * Presence wire protocol: the relay-owned peer list, plus the one frame the
 * node sends to publish its own presence identity.
 *
 * The relay owns presence (its `connections` map is the source of truth) and
 * broadcasts the FULL peer list on every membership change. The client stores
 * the latest list verbatim: there is no delta protocol and no client-side
 * reassembly, the frame IS the state.
 *
 * Presence is liveness and participant identity, not capability
 * advertisement: the payload is each peer's `nodeId`, `connectedAt`, and
 * `agentId`. Action manifests and route catalogs are not presence; actions
 * live in the local registry, never on the wire.
 *
 * Shared by the relay (`packages/server/src/room/core.ts`, the sender) and
 * the client (`open-collaboration.ts`, the reader).
 *
 * Schemas are TypeBox: they ARE valid JSON Schema at runtime, double as the
 * source of truth for the TypeScript types via `Static`, and feed
 * `typebox/compile`'s `Compile()` to produce checked-once validators reused
 * at every boundary. No hand-written duck-typing helpers.
