 * Per-workspace data layout helpers.
 *
 * `epicenterRoot` is the Epicenter root: the app folder that holds
 * `epicenter.config.ts`. It is NOT necessarily the repo root.
 *
 * Hidden machine state under `<epicenterRoot>/.epicenter/`, each folder named by
 * what's inside:
 *
 *   yjs/<id>.db     Yjs CRDT update log (durability; replayed by Yjs)
 *   sqlite/<id>.db  Queryable SQL surface (open with `sqlite3`, FTS5)
 *   md/<id>/        Legacy hidden markdown tree (playground daemons only)
 *
 * These helpers return the hardcoded convention only; they do not inspect
 * `epicenter.config.ts`.
 *
 * For daemon-process paths (sockets, log, metadata sidecar), see
 * `daemon/paths.ts`. Different audience, different rationale.
 *
 * Pure helpers: no side effects, no directory creation. Consumers do their
 * own `mkdir` (or rely on the attachments to do it).
