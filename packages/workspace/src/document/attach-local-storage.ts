/**
 * `attachLocalStorage`: pair plaintext IndexedDB persistence with a
 * `(server, ownerId)`-scoped BroadcastChannel for a Y.Doc.
 *
 * One call covers both browser-local surfaces because they are always paired
 * for an authenticated workspace doc: writes that go to IDB also need to
 * cross-tab broadcast under the same owner scope, and the database
 * name and channel name must match so two tabs of the same owner share both
 * storage and live updates.
 *
 * Names are derived via {@link createOwnedYjsKey}. Two signed-in owners on
 * the same browser profile, or one owner signed into two different self-hosted
 * instances on the same machine, never collide on local storage or
 * BroadcastChannel.
 *
 * Returns the IDB attachment so callers can await `whenLoaded` (e.g. to gate
 * `openCollaboration({ waitFor: idb.whenLoaded })`) or `whenDisposed` during
 * wipe orchestration.
 *

/**
 * Attach `(server, ownerId)`-scoped plaintext IndexedDB persistence plus a
 * matching BroadcastChannel to `ydoc`.
 *
 * `server` and `ownerId` are stable for the lifetime of the attachment: they
 * become the IDB database name and BroadcastChannel key prefix, so two
 * accounts on the same browser profile do not share local workspace data
 * and two self-hosted instances on the same machine do not collide either.
 * Snapshotted at attach time; session lifecycles guarantee stability by
 * disposing the workspace on sign-out and re-mounting on the next sign-in.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * const idb = attachLocalStorage(ydoc, {
 *   server: new URL(connection.baseURL).host,
 *   ownerId: connection.ownerId,
 * });
 * await idb.whenLoaded;
