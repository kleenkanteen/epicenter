/**
 * Wire URL paths and Hono route patterns for the Epicenter API.
 *
 * The shared home for API route contracts whose domain has no dedicated shared
 * package of its own: the session projection, the content-addressed blob store,
 * and the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` inference gateways. This is not a registry of
 * every route in the repo. A route whose domain already owns a shared package
 * lives there instead, beside the protocol it belongs to: `@epicenter/sync`
 * owns the room route (`ROOM_ROUTE`, `/api/rooms/:roomId`) next to its message
 * framing, because both the sync server and the workspace client import it.
 * These leaves live here only because their two sides (server and the client
 * SDK) share nothing else they could hang the path on.
 *
 * Each leaf exposes some of:
 *
 *   - `pattern`        Hono-style route string (`/api/.../:param{regex}`)
 *                      consumed by `subApp.get(...)` declarations and
 *                      deployment `.use(...)` / `.on(...)` mounts. Server-side.
 *   - `prefixPattern`  Wildcard variant (`/api/.../*`) for prefix-scoped
 *                      `.use(...)` middleware. A server mount helper, not a
 *                      client contract: it lives beside the bare `pattern` only
 *                      so the shared path literal stays in one place and cannot
 *                      drift from it. Present only where the surface has
 *                      subpaths the bare pattern misses; no client reads it.
 *   - `url(...)`       Builder that produces a concrete absolute URL from typed
 *                      inputs, all path parameters `encodeURIComponent`-encoded.
 *                      Client-side; the URL a client fetches is the public
 *                      contract.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Server route declaration
 * import { API_ROUTES } from '@epicenter/constants/api-routes';
 * const sessionApp = new Hono<Env>()
 *   .get(API_ROUTES.session.pattern, handler);
 *
 * // Deployment middleware (server-only prefixPattern)
 * app.use(API_ROUTES.ai.completions.prefixPattern, requireBearerPrincipal);
 *
 * // Client fetch (the url() output is the public contract)
 * const res = await fetch(API_ROUTES.session.url(baseURL));
 * ```
