/**
 * Build-time helper for serving the VAD runtime assets. This module is meant for
 * an app's Vite config (Node), not browser code.
 *
 * `@ricky0123/vad-web` fetches its worklet, Silero ONNX model, and onnxruntime
 * wasm from a base path at runtime (default `/vad/`, see `createVadRecorder`'s
 * `assetBaseUrl`); the files are not bundled. Each consuming app must copy them
 * out of the installed packages so they are served at that path. This resolves
 * the source paths from this package's own dependency tree so every consumer
 * copies the exact files the lockfile pins.
 *
 * onnxruntime-web is a transitive dependency of @ricky0123/vad-web, not declared
 * here, so it is unreachable directly under an isolated (pnpm-style)
 * node_modules. Resolve it relative to vad-web's own entry instead, which works
 * under both hoisted and isolated installs. Resolve each package's entry, not a
 * package.json subpath, which onnxruntime-web blocks via `exports`.
