/**
 * The runtime `matter.json` parser/validator.
 *
 * `matter.json` at rest is `{ "fields": { [fieldName]: <a plain JSON Schema> } }`, where
 * each field value is a plain JSON Schema in the closed palette. This module turns that
 * raw JSON into a {@link Contract}: a flat list of {@link ContractField}s, each carrying
 * its kind (the widget / storage classifier) and its precompiled validator, computed
 * ONCE here when the contract loads. "Field" is the source noun (the user defines a
 * folder's fields); SQLite is the one consumer that turns fields into table columns.
 *
 * The palette is the shared `@epicenter/field` vocabulary: the SAME kinds the workspace
 * authors through `field.*`, so `recognize` and `compile` round-trip matter's `matter.json`
 * over one wire-form. `json` is a kind (an arbitrary-JSON payload, marker-discriminated),
 * so matter renders it too. Matter's substrate policy keeps the emptiness axis outside
 * the value schema: `fields.*` is a pure JSON Schema for PRESENT values, while top-level
 * contract policy decides whether a missing value is allowed. A nullable `anyOf`-with-null
 * shape is outside the palette and degrades to raw, and the per-kind widgets in
 * `components/fields/` map each `Kind` to its editor.
 *
 * The acceptance rule is the meta-schema in `@epicenter/field`: a field whose stored
 * shape is a legal palette member becomes a typed Field; a field OUTSIDE the palette (a
 * typo, an unmarked object, a nullable wrapper) is recorded in `untyped` and shown raw,
 * rather than erroring the whole contract. Only WHOLE-FILE junk (bad JSON, a non-object
 * top level) rejects the contract to the raw view; an object with no `fields` map is the
 * canonical untyped marker (the raw grid), not a rejection.
 *
 * Optionality is a Matter policy, not a field-palette kind. By default every typed
 * field is required; top-level `optional: ["name"]` names the exceptions. "Must have
 * content" is still a value constraint (e.g. `minLength`), not a requiredness flag.
 *
 * Searchability is the same shape of policy: top-level `searchable: ["body", "name"]` names the
 * columns indexed for full-text search, defaulting to `body` plus every TEXT-storage field. It lives
 * at the top level (not in a field's value schema) for the same reason `optional` does, and the key
 * exists only because the SQLite projection's FTS5 index exists.
