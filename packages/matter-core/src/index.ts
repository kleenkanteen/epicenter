/**
 * `@epicenter/matter-core`: Matter's engine, with no UI, Tauri, or browser coupling.
 *
 * It parses a folder of typed markdown (one `.md` file per row, YAML frontmatter typed by a per-folder
 * `matter.json`, the body as the rich field), classifies each row's conformance, resolves cross-table
 * references, and projects the whole vault into a read-only SQLite schema. Disk is the source of truth;
 * the SQLite projection is disposable and never written back to (ADR-0026, ADR-0065).
 *
 * Two consumers share it: `apps/matter` renders from it, and `epicenter matter check` lints from it.
 * This entry is browser-pure. The filesystem boundary (`loadPath`, `loadTable`) uses `node:fs`, so it
 * lives behind the `@epicenter/matter-core/fs` subpath, kept out of this barrel so the Tauri client's
 * import graph never reaches `node:fs`.
