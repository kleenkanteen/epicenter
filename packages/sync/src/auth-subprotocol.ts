/**
 * WebSocket subprotocol auth: shared client/server constants.
 *
 * Auth tokens travel inside the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` handshake header
 * as `bearer.<token>`, not in the URL's query string. The real threat is
 * server-side access logs (Cloudflare, Hono middleware, downstream APMs
 * like Sentry/Datadog): full URLs including query strings are captured by
 * default, so a `?token=` scheme leaks long-lived session tokens into any
 * system with log access. Subprotocol headers aren't captured by default
 * on those systems. The server extracts and consumes the bearer entry on
 * upgrade; only the main protocol name (`epicenter`) is echoed back on
 * the 101 response, so the token never round-trips.
 *
 * The `.` separator is required by RFC compliance: `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol`
 * values are RFC 7230 `token` productions, where `:` is not a valid `tchar`
 * but `.` is. Prior art for `<scheme>.<token>`: Phoenix channels
 * (`phx_bearer.<token>`), Supabase Realtime, and Kubernetes
 * (`base64url.bearer.authorization.k8s.io.<token>`).

/**
 * Rejection an auth-owned `openWebSocket` throws when it refuses to open a

 *
 * `permanence` carries the same semantics as the server's auth close codes,
 * so the sync supervisor makes one park-or-backoff decision for both failure
 * carriers:
 *
 * - `'permanent'` (like close 4401): only an auth state change can produce a
 *   credential (signed out, reauth required). Park; `auth.onStateChange` is
 *   the wake signal.
 * - `'transient'` (like close 4503): credential verification was unreachable;
 *   the grant may be perfectly good. Back off and retry.
 *
 * `code` names the specific refusal (`'signed-out'`, `'reauth-required'`,
 * `'auth-unavailable'`) for status surfaces and logs; consumers branch on
 * `permanence`, not `code`.
 *
 * Declared here, beside the subprotocol carrier, because it is the other half
 * of the same client-side transport contract: `@epicenter/auth` constructs it
 * and the sync supervisor classifies it, and both already depend on this
 * package.
