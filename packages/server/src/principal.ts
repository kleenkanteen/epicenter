 * extension, CLI, daemon). What lives here are the durable strings only
 * a server cares about: Durable Object names, R2 object keys, and the
 * partition path segment they all share.
 *
 * Per-user and instance share the exact same path shape. The partition
 * segment is always `principals/<principalId>`. In the hosted topology the
 * principal may be a Better Auth user id; on an instance it is the pinned constant
 * `INSTANCE_PRINCIPAL_ID` (the literal `instance`). The path is honest either way:
 * every durable identifier the server writes is rooted at
 * `principals/<principalId>`.
 *
 * Every durable string follows the rule:
 *   `principals/<principalId>/<resource type>/<id>`
 *
 * One shape, one helper per resource type, no ternary.
