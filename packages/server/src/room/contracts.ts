/**
 * Vocabulary for the runtime-agnostic room system.
 *
 * Hand-declared types that multiple backends implement and
 * {@link createRoomCore} consumes. The factory-per-backend pattern uses
 * `satisfies` to prove each backend's concrete return shape matches these
 * types while keeping that concrete shape navigable in editors.
 *
 * ## What lives here
 *
 * - {@link RoomUpdateLog}: per-room persistent update log. Backends supply
 *   the storage; the contract is synchronous because the Yjs `updateV2`
 *   callback that calls `append` cannot await.
 * - {@link RoomSocket}: the minimal per-connection WebSocket surface.
 *   Structural by design so both Cloudflare's hibernation `WebSocket` and
 *   Bun's `ServerWebSocket` satisfy it natively, no wrapper required.
 * - {@link ResolvedRoom} / {@link Rooms}: name-to-room routing
 *   consumed by route middleware in `app.ts`.
 * - {@link RoomError}: error variants surfaced across the room's
 *   untrusted-input boundary (the binary WebSocket frame).
 *
 * @see `room/core.ts` for the consumer (`createRoomCore`).
 * @see `room/backends/cloudflare/` for the Cloudflare backend.
