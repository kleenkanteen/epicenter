/**
 * Runtime-agnostic Yjs sync room.
 *
 * Owns: the Yjs document, the connection set, and server-owned presence.
 * Does NOT own the WebSocket lifecycle (fetch/upgrade/`webSocketMessage`
 * callbacks), the alarm scheduling, or the update-log storage; those are
 * backend-specific and live in the adapter.
 *
 * Imports no `cloudflare:workers` symbols. Both Cloudflare's Durable
 * Object and the Bun backend (`room/backends/bun/`) drive the same
 * {@link createRoomCore} instance through the methods listed on its return
 * object. Connection-lifetime enforcement and liveness ping/pong are
 * room-core invariants here, so neither backend can forget them.
 *
 * ## Wire surfaces
 *
 * Two wire surfaces share one authenticated socket but are independent at
 * the protocol level:
 *
 *   binary WS frames  -> standard y-protocols SYNC.
 *   text WS frames    -> the server-owned presence channel (`presence` /
 *                        `presence_publish`), plus relay-channel frames the
 *                        core delegates whole to the channel router.
 *
 * ## Presence
 *
 * Presence is server-owned: the `connections` map is the source of truth.
 * On every connection change a `presence` text frame is broadcast carrying
 * the FULL client list (computed per-recipient, self excluded), so clients
 * store the list verbatim with no delta reassembly.
 *
 * ## Adapter contract
 *
 * Backends drive `RoomCore` through these entry points:
 *
 *   - `addConnection(socket, connection)`     on accept
 *   - `removeConnection(socket, code)`         on close
 *   - `handleMessage(socket, message)`         on inbound frame
 *   - `compact()`                              after idle
 *
 * `connectionCount` is exposed as a query so the backend can schedule
 * deferred compaction when the room empties.
