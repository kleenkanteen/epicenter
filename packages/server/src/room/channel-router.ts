/**
 * The relay-channel router: the server half of the universal device-channel
 * relay's floor.
 *
 * It multiplexes named request/response channels (the four `channel_*` frames of
 * `@epicenter/workspace/relay-channel`) over the account-room WebSocket each
 * device already holds, forwarding a channel's bytes BLIND between a caller
 * socket and a target device's socket. It never parses the MCP (or HTTP) payload
 * inside a `channel_data` frame.
 *
 * This is a clean GENERALIZATION of the deleted dispatch path, not a revival:
 * the deleted relay parsed `action`/`input` and a typed `Result`, and that logic
 * lived inside the sync text-frame handler (`core.ts`) and `open-collaboration`.
 * This router imports nothing from Yjs sync, MCP, the action registry, or any
 * workspace reducer; it depends only on the wire {@link ChannelFrame} protocol
 * and the minimal {@link RoomSocket} surface. `RoomCore` reaches it through one
 * delegation in `handleTextFrame` and one call in `removeConnection`; the sync
 * layer never learns a channel exists. Sharing the connection is fine; coupling
 * the channel logic to the sync logic is the trap this separation avoids.
 *
 * The relay enforces routing integrity from the already-authenticated identity:
 * it routes only among sockets of the same principal (the per-principal fleet that shares
 * the account room) and never lets a caller forge the peer it reaches. It is NOT
 * the security boundary on the tool call; that stays the device endpoint's own
 * check (the [collapse spec]'s "the endpoint is the boundary, never the relay").
