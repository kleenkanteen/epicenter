 * Regression: prove the real client/server URL contract.
 *
 * The client builds request URLs with `ROOM_ROUTE.url(...)` and the
 * server registers `ROOM_ROUTE.pattern`. This test wires both ends to the
 * same source of truth so a future change to the pattern or builder can't let
 * them drift apart. It also pins that dotted, composed child-doc guids survive
 * Hono route matching (Hono treats `.` as a literal, so a single `:roomId`
 * param captures the whole id).
