/**
 * @epicenter/server
 *
 * One shared Hono library, two deployables (ADR-0075): the hosted Epicenter
 * Cloud (many Better Auth users resolving to principals) and the self-hosted
 * single-partition instance (one pinned `principals/instance` partition behind
 * one operator bearer).
 *
 * Deployments construct the server app, resolve requests to principals, then
 * mount each reusable surface with the matching `mount*` primitive. Each
 * primitive owns its auth wiring; the deployment passes only auth and any
 * deployment policies (e.g. cloud billing middleware).
 * Sub-apps declare full URLs (including the `/api` prefix where
 * applicable). See `apps/api/worker/index.ts` for the cloud composition.
