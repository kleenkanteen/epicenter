/**
 * Force a Bun `server.upgrade` to echo only the main subprotocol, by rewriting
 * the inbound request's `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header in place before the
 * upgrade.
 *
 * Bun's uWS layer negotiates by auto-echoing the client's FIRST offered
 * subprotocol, so without this a client that ordered `bearer.<token>` first
 * would get its credential echoed on the 101. The two other channels do not
 * work here: passing `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` via `options.headers` writes a
 * SECOND copy of the header beside uWS's negotiated one (clients then fail the
 * handshake with 1002; verified on Bun 1.3.3), and reconstructing the request
 * severs the internal upgrade context (`server.upgrade` returns false on
 * anything but the exact object `fetch` received). Mutating the live header on
 * the original object threads that needle: identity is preserved and uWS reads
 * the rewritten value at upgrade time (also verified).
 *
 * Shared by every Bun WebSocket surface that carries a `bearer.<token>`
 * subprotocol a browser upgrade cannot otherwise send safely: the rooms backend
 * (`room/backends/bun/registry.ts`) and the AttachRelay transport
 * (`attach-relay/bun-server.ts`). Each surface guarantees a main-subprotocol
 * offer on every path that upgrades (the route refuses offers without it), so
 * the sanitized header is `epicenter` exactly; the delete branch is defense in
 * depth for a client that offered only non-main protocols: no header, nothing
 * to auto-echo.
