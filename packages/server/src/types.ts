 * consult the cookie and how they surface a failure; the user resolution itself
 * is this single function. The deployment builds each wrapper by closing it over
 * its resolver (`requireBearerUser(resolveUser)`), so the resolver is held in the
 * wrapper's closure, not stamped on the context: there is no `c.var.resolveUser`.
 *
 * The cloud closes over the real resolver (`resolveRequestOAuthUser`: an OAuth
 * bearer verified against JWKS); an instance closes over its env-token resolver
 * (`createEnvTokenResolver`). A dev-only entrypoint closes over a trivial
 * `Bearer dev:<userId>` resolver so the runtime-parity smoke needs no interactive
 * login; that bypass lives in a dev entry production never imports, never an
 * env-gated branch in this library.
 *
 * Returns the same `Result<AuthUser, OAuthError>` every resolver returns, so a
 * different resolver slots in without touching the wrappers' error handling
 * (HTTP 401, the OAuth `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, or the rooms 4401 close).
 *
 * Generic over the context it reads: the instance's env-token resolver needs only
 * the portable {@link Env}; the cloud's `resolveRequestOAuthUser` reads `c.var.auth`
 * + `c.var.db`, so it is a `ResolveUser<CloudEnv>`. The wrapper that closes over a
 * resolver carries the same `E`, so a cloud resolver only composes onto a cloud app.
