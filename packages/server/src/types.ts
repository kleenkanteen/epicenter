 * the rooms bearer with its WebSocket-reject path) own credential EXTRACTION:
 * each knows where its transport carries the token (`Authorization` header, or
 * the `bearer.<token>` WebSocket subprotocol for rooms) and hands the resolver
 * a bare token. The resolver only VERIFIES; it never reads request headers, so
 * no transport ever has to fake another transport's header to authenticate.
 * The deployment builds each wrapper by closing it over its resolver
 * (`requireBearerPrincipal(resolveBearerPrincipal)`), so the resolver is held in
 * the wrapper's closure, not stamped on the context: there is no
 * `c.var.resolveBearerPrincipal`.
 *
 * The cloud closes over the real resolver (`resolveRequestOAuthPrincipal`: an
 * OAuth bearer verified against JWKS); an instance closes over its env-token
 * resolver (`createEnvTokenResolver`). A dev-only entrypoint closes over a trivial
 * `dev:<principalId>` resolver so the runtime-parity smoke needs no interactive
 * login; that bypass lives in a dev entry production never imports, never an
 * env-gated branch in this library.
 *
 * Returns the same `Result<Principal, OAuthError>` every resolver returns, so a
 * different resolver slots in without touching the wrappers' error handling
 * (HTTP 401, the OAuth `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, or the rooms 4401 close).
 *
 * Generic over the context it reads: the instance's env-token resolver needs only
 * the portable {@link Env}; the cloud's `resolveRequestOAuthPrincipal` reads
 * `c.var.auth` + `c.var.db`, so it is a `ResolveBearerPrincipal<CloudEnv>`. The
 * wrapper that closes over a resolver carries the same `E`, so a cloud resolver
