/**
 * Merge the two Bun `WebSocketHandler`s a self-hosted instance serves, the
 * rooms backend and the AttachRelay, into the one handler `Bun.serve` accepts,
 * dispatching each socket to its owner by the `surface` tag on `ws.data`.
 *
 * `Bun.serve` accepts exactly ONE `websocket` handler, but a Bun host that
 * serves both the rooms surface and the AttachRelay needs both on one port and
 * one server (a WebSocket cannot pick a port after connecting). Each backend
 * owns a DISJOINT `ws.data` shape (`createBunRooms` tags `surface: 'rooms'`,
 * `createAttachRelayBunServer` tags `surface: 'attach'`) and its own coordinator
 * state, so this merge never blends the two: it reads the tag stamped at
 * `server.upgrade` time and forwards every lifecycle callback to the one handler
 * that owns that socket. The `surface` tag is a server-side dispatch discriminant
 * on `ws.data`, never a wire or addressing field: it never reaches a relay frame,
 * so it is not the "channel router" ADR-0115 forbids.
 *
 * This is a two-surface merge on purpose, not a generic N-way router: a Bun
 * instance has exactly these two WebSocket surfaces, and a third one earns a new
 * ADR, not another map entry. Both backends bind the SAME `Server` (`bindServer`
 * on each) so their respective `handleUpgrade`/`fetch` calls upgrade onto the one
 * Bun server this merged handler drives.
