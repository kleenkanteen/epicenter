/**
 * Mount the AttachRelay on a Bun deployment behind its bearer gate (ADR-0115:
 * self-host symmetry). A self-hosted instance serves the relay
 * coordinator reached by URL and operator token (ADR-0075), so a desktop host
 * and a client attach against a self-host and it "just works after sign-in."
 * This is the one way the relay is reached: every attach is authenticated and
 * the principal is stamped server-side, so there is no unauthenticated path and
 * no second principal-resolution model.
 *
 * ## Why this surface stamps the principal
 *
 * The relay addresses endpoints only (`principalId`, `hostId`, `deviceId`,
 * `attachId`). On the authenticated mount, `principalId` is NOT read from the
 * query: the bearer resolves server-side to the one principal this deployment
 * admits (the literal `instance` principal on self-host, ADR-0075), and that
 * resolved id is stamped onto the socket. A client that puts a different
 * `principalId` in its query cannot address another partition, and a client
 * with no valid bearer cannot connect at all: the surface is fail-closed behind
 * `INSTANCE_TOKEN`.
 *
 * ## Not a route surface
 *
 * There is one path (`/attach`) and the query carries only the endpoint
 * quadruple plus `role`. This adds no route, channel, capability, action, or
 * per-host directory; it only authenticates the one relay surface the
 * coordinator already shaped. The credential rides `Authorization` (a non-browser client)
 * or the `bearer.<token>` subprotocol (a browser), the same two channels the
 * rooms upgrade reads, and the 101 echoes only the main subprotocol so the
 * token never round-trips.
