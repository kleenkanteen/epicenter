/**
 * Per-device attach grants (ADR-0115): the revocable allowlist that replaces the
 * single shared operator token on the attach surface.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A single shared operator bearer (`INSTANCE_TOKEN`) cannot let one device in and
 * another out: every device that holds the token attaches, and there is no way to
 * cut just one off. Per-device grants split that one credential into a revocable
 * list. A device pairs once (the operator mints it a grant, handed over out of
 * band as a QR or a paste), presents that grant on connect, and revoking the
 * grant kills the device's next attach without touching any other device or the
 * sync plane.
 *
 * ## Where it sits, and what it does not touch
 *
 * This is the "account and device layer" ADR-0115 clause 3 puts pairing and
 * device grants in: it lives beside the attach mount (`attach-relay/mount.ts`),
 * NOT inside the relay coordinator (`attach-relay/core.ts`). The coordinator stays
 * grant-blind and frame-blind: it still forwards opaque bytes addressed by
 * `principalId`, `hostId`, `deviceId`, `attachId`, and it never learns a grant
 * exists. The grant is checked once, at the mount's auth boundary, before the
 * socket ever reaches the coordinator.
 *
 * ## The seam it fills
 *
 * The store's {@link DeviceGrantStore.resolveBearerPrincipal} is a plain
 * {@link ResolveBearerPrincipal}: exactly the seam `createEnvTokenResolver`
 * fills, so the attach mount closes over it with no change to
 * `mountAttachRelayApp`. It resolves any LIVE grant to the one instance principal
 * (`INSTANCE_PRINCIPAL_ID`), the same principal the operator
 * token resolves to, so grants never re-partition: they are a finer credential for
 * the same single partition (ADR-0075), never a second principal model.
 *
 * ## Grant shape
 *
 * A grant's secret is a strong random URL-safe token (the same generator the
 * operator token uses). The store keeps only the token's SHA-256 digest, never the
 * raw secret: `mint` returns the secret once (the pairing payload), and thereafter
 * only its hash is at rest. Resolution hashes the presented bearer and looks the
 * digest up, so a timing attacker would need a preimage of the digest to forge a
 * grant, the same argument `createEnvTokenResolver`'s constant-time compare rests
 * on. Revocation deletes the digest, so the next connect misses the lookup and
 * fails closed.
 *
 * ## Deliberately not built here (smallest model, ADR-0115 clause 3)
 *
 * - The grant is not bound to the connect's query `deviceId`: the `deviceId` is
 *   recorded at mint time so the operator can see and revoke "my old phone," but
 *   the relay's `deviceId`/`attachId` stay opaque addressing labels, never trusted
 *   identity. Binding a grant to one `deviceId` at connect is a refinement
 *   deferred until a directory needs trusted device identity.
 * - Grants are not scoped by role: any live grant can register as a host or attach
 *   as a client. On a single-principal instance every grant is the operator's own
 *   paired device, so role scoping would guard only within-owner behavior; it is
 *   deferred until a real threat earns it.
 * - Revocation kills future connects, not live sockets: closing an in-flight
 *   attach on revoke would make the store hold socket handles or reach into the
 *   coordinator, and the target is "dead on the next connect." Live-socket
 *   eviction is a later refinement.
 * - The store is in-memory: grants do not survive a process restart, so a restart
 *   re-pairs devices. Persisting them (a `bun:sqlite` file beside the rooms, like
 *   the operator token's own durability story) is deferred until a real need earns
 *   it.
