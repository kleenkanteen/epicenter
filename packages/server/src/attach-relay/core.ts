/**
 * The AttachRelay coordinator (ADR-0115): pair many client endpoints to one
 * host endpoint under a principal, and forward opaque bytes between them. This
 * is the byte-forwarding primitive of clause 4, generic only in the narrow
 * sense of clause 1: it forwards opaque bytes between two endpoints, addressed
 * by `principalId`, `hostId`, `deviceId`, `attachId`, and never by a route
 * name. It is not a routing product; it has one consumer (Super Chat attach).
 *
 * ## Transport-agnostic by design
 *
 * Like `room/core.ts`, the coordinator holds no transport. It takes structural
 * {@link RelaySocket}s and returns connection handles a transport drives on its
 * socket's message and close: a Bun WebSocket server (`attach-relay/bun-server`),
 * a Cloudflare Durable Object (`attach-relay/cloudflare-do`), or a test double.
 * The coordinator never binds a port and never parses a `payload`.
 *
 * ## What it forwards, and how it addresses
 *
 * - A host registers under `(principalId, hostId)` (one host per pair).
 * - A client attaches under `(principalId, hostId, deviceId, attachId)`.
 * - Client to host: the client's opaque bytes reach the host stamped with the
 *   source endpoint `(deviceId, attachId)`, so the host knows which endpoint to
 *   answer. Attach and detach reach the host as lifecycle events on the same
 *   wire, so the host can push a fresh client its first snapshot and drop a
 *   gone one.
 * - Host to client: the host addresses one client endpoint per frame; the
 *   relay delivers it to that socket. There is no broadcast primitive: N
 *   clients is N host frames. Per-endpoint addressing is only how the host
 *   answers the right client; the relay is trusted transport, not an encryption
 *   boundary (ADR-0115 clause 2, the sealing layer was removed by amendment).
 *
 * The relay reads the envelope (`deviceId`, `attachId`) and nothing else: the
 * `payload` is opaque bytes it never decodes.
