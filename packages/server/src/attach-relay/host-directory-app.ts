/**
 * The client's host-discovery surface (ADR-0115 clause 3): `GET /attach/hosts`
 * returns this principal's attachable Super Chat hosts, each as the closed
 * `{ hostId, label, status }` entry and nothing else. It is the step before
 * attach: a signed-in phone learns which desktops it may dial and whether one is
 * live, then points the existing AttachRelay client at the chosen `hostId`.
 *
 * ## Read-only, and closed
 *
 * This is a plain HTTP read at the account-and-device layer, above the relay. It
 * carries no route name, capability, action, tool, or topic: the response items
 * are {@link AttachHostDirectoryEntry}s, whose schema rejects every such field, so
 * the directory cannot grow into a capability registry (the PR #2277 guard). There
 * is no write route here: a host publishes itself by the act of connecting as a
 * host (the mount records its membership), and liveness is the live host socket,
 * never a heartbeat the client PUTs. The one surface is this GET.
 *
 * ## Same shape, two sources
 *
 * The deployment binds the backend through `resolveHostDirectory`, exactly the
 * `resolveRelay`/`resolveRooms` seam: a Bun self-host returns its process
 * directory (`createAttachRelayBunServer().hostDirectory`), and a Cloud
 * per-principal index is a later refinement behind the same seam. The mount stays
 * backend-blind; the principal is stamped from the resolved bearer, never the
 * query, so a client only ever reads its own principal's hosts.
