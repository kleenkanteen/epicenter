/**
 * The attach host directory entry (ADR-0115): the whole of what a
 * signed-in client may learn about an attachable Super Chat host before it
 * attaches. A client discovers a host by `hostId`, a human `label`, and a
 * liveness `status`, and by nothing else. The directory names what to dial, not
 * what the host can do.
 *
 * ## Why this is a closed schema
 *
 * With one consumer, an attachable host is a Super Chat host by definition
 * (ADR-0115 clause 3), so there is no capability field to carry: adding one
 * would be `exposedRoutes` in a closed-enum costume. This entry is therefore a
 * `.onUndeclaredKey('reject')` schema, so any route-, capability-, action-, or
 * tool-shaped field (`capability`, `route`, `exposedRoutes`, `action`, `tools`,
 * `methods`, `method`, `path`, `name`, `topic`, `toolName`, a `tools/list` or
 * `tools/call` verb) fails to parse. That is PR #2277's presence-schema guard,
 * re-homed onto the AttachRelay directory: the directory cannot grow into a
 * capability registry, because an undeclared key has nowhere to land.
 *
 * ## Where this sits
 *
 * This is the account-and-device-layer directory ADR-0115 clause 3 puts above
 * the relay, beside the device grants (`device-grants.ts`), never inside the
 * relay coordinator (`core.ts`), which stays byte-, frame-, key-, and
 * directory-blind: it forwards opaque bytes addressed by `principalId`,
 * `hostId`, `deviceId`, `attachId`, and never learns a directory exists.
 *
 * ## How membership and liveness split (the two facts a status is)
 *
 * A directory entry is a join of two facts that live in different owners:
 * - **membership + label** ("this principal's known desktops and their names")
 *   is what {@link createHostDirectory} retains. A host publishes itself by the
 *   act of connecting as a host (`role=host`, the mount records `hostId`+`label`
 *   here); a client never performs that act, so it is structurally absent. There
 *   is no host/client discriminator to store or filter: membership IS the trace
 *   of the host-register act. Membership is retained after disconnect, so an
 *   asleep desktop still lists as `offline` rather than vanishing.
 * - **liveness** ("is a host socket live right now") belongs to the coordinator
 *   (`core.ts` `liveHostIds`), the single conflict-correct source. A
 *   {@link HostDirectoryReader} joins the two at read time, so a crashed host is
 *   never a stale `online`: the coordinator drops it, and the retained
 *   membership renders `offline`.
 *
 * The store is in-memory and per-process (a restart forgets membership, exactly
 * as the grant store and coordinator do); persisting it is deferred until a real
 * need earns it. The `unreachable` status is emitted only by a store that can
 * hold "claimed online but the socket is dead" (the Cloud per-principal index,
 * deferred); the Bun self-host reader here emits only `online`/`offline`, and
 * the client's ask-gate treats `offline` and `unreachable` identically.
 */

/**
 * A host's liveness in the directory, the whole signal a client dials on. Three
 * states, because the phone must tell "wake your desktop" from "reconnecting"
 * (ADR-0115):
 * - `online`: the host endpoint is registered and reachable for a fresh attach.
 * - `offline`: the desktop is not connected at all (asleep or shut down).
 * - `unreachable`: the host is known but its live channel is not usable right
 *   now (its relay socket dropped, or a partition), so a fresh attach cannot
 *   form even though the desktop is not definitively gone.
 *
 * Both `offline` and `unreachable` deny a new local-source question and both
 * still allow reading synced history: reading is a durable-replica read that
 * needs no live host (ADR-0055), while asking needs the live session. The two
 * are kept distinct so a client renders the right recovery, never so the relay
 * routes on them; the relay never sees this enum.
