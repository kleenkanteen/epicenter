/**
 * Vocabulary for the AttachRelay (ADR-0115): Epicenter forwards live Super Chat
 * bytes between two authenticated endpoints of one principal, a signed-in client
 * and a desktop Super Chat host. The relay is endpoint-addressed, never
 * route-addressed: it routes by the quadruple `principalId`, `hostId`,
 * `deviceId`, `attachId`, and by nothing else. There is no route name, no route
 * registry, no capability field. Those are the relay-floor organs deleted in
 * PR #2277, and endpoint addressing is what keeps them from having anywhere to
 * live (ADR-0115 clause 1).
 *
 * ## What the relay owns
 *
 * The relay owns the endpoint envelope and socket fan-out. It does not own Super
 * Chat command semantics, host snapshots, tool names, or local-source reach. The
 * payload is trusted transport data: hosted Cloud may observe it, but the relay
 * still stores no frames and exposes no route or capability surface.
 *
 * @see `attach-relay/core.ts` for the coordinator that consumes these types.

 * beyond the envelope the host wire wraps it in. `readyState` follows the
 * WebSocket spec (CONNECTING=0, OPEN=1, CLOSING=2, CLOSED=3) so the coordinator
