/**
 * Cloudflare Durable Object backend for the {@link createAttachRelay}
 * coordinator (ADR-0115): the hosted Cloud transport that holds the live
 * rendezvous sockets between a signed-in desktop Super Chat host and a signed-in
 * phone/client of the same principal. It is the Cloud twin of the Bun transport
 * (`attach-relay/bun-server`); both drive the one runtime-agnostic coordinator.
 *
 * ## One DO per `(principalId, hostId)` pair
 *
 * The coordinator pairs a host with its clients in memory, so a host and every
 * client attaching to it MUST land on the same actor. {@link createDurableObjectAttachRelay}
 * derives the DO name from `(principalId, hostId)` ({@link attachHostDoName}), so
 * every socket of one pair routes to one DO. Each DO therefore holds exactly one
 * host entry; the coordinator is reused verbatim, not cloned. The `principalId`
 * is the partition: a client whose bearer resolves to another principal, even one
 * guessing a `hostId`, is stamped with its OWN principal and routes to its own
 * (empty) DO, so it pairs with no host, HOST_NOT_FOUND. That is the same
 * account-isolation invariant `cloud-attach.test.ts` proves through the mount.
 *
 * ## Standard accept, not the hibernation API
 *
 * Unlike the room DO, this backend accepts sockets with `server.accept()` rather
 * than the WebSocket Hibernation API. A live attach keeps both ends online (the
 * relay stores no frames and needs both peers, ADR-0115 clause 5), so pinning the
 * DO in memory for the connection's life is honest: the in-memory coordinator
 * stays coherent with its open sockets with no attachment serialization and no
 * rebuild-on-wake. Hibernation would also have to replay the coordinator's
 * per-client `attach` lifecycle event on every wake, re-pushing snapshots the
 * host already sent; standard accept sidesteps that entirely. This DO owns no
 * `ctx.storage` and arms no alarm: it is a pure socket router. Hibernating a
 * connected-but-idle attach is a deferred optimization behind this same seam, not
 * a correctness need for a live session.
 *
 * ## RelaySocket compatibility
 *
 * Cloudflare's `WebSocket` exposes `send`, `close(code, reason)`, and
 * `readyState`, so it structurally satisfies {@link RelaySocket} and the raw
 * socket is handed straight to the coordinator with no wrapper, the same move the
 * Bun and room backends make.
