/**
 * Portable drizzle database handle.

 * `createDb(client)` wraps a connected `pg` client or pool in drizzle with
 * the library's own schema, so the schema stays internal to
 * `@epicenter/server` and a deployment hands in only a connected client.
 * Both runtime db backends funnel through this: the Cloudflare backend (a
 * per-request `pg.Client` over Hyperdrive, see `db/backends/cloudflare.ts`)
 * and a Node host (a module-scope `pg.Pool`). `pg` + drizzle are the open
 * Postgres-wire standard both runtimes already speak (ADR-0066 Road 1); only
 * connection acquisition differs, which is what the runtime's `db.connect` injects.
