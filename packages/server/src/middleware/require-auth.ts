/**
 * Cookie-or-bearer authentication.
 *
 * Resolves `c.var.user` from a Better Auth session cookie if one is
 * present; otherwise falls back to an OAuth bearer for the API audience.
 * Use this on routes served to both first-party browser callers (portal,
 * dashboard, hosted UIs) and external OAuth clients (CLI, Tauri,
 * extension).
 *
 * For routes that are external-clients only (`/api/ai/*`, `/api/.../rooms/*`),
 * prefer {@link requireBearerUser}, which skips the cookie attempt.
 *
 * Cookie-vs-bearer is resolved deterministically here, cookie-first: a
 * request carrying both uses the cookie session and never consults the
 * bearer. The two credentials are read by disjoint paths and never merge,
 * so there is nothing to police at the edge: `getSession` reads only the
 * cookie (Better Auth's `bearer()` plugin is not enabled), while the bearer
 * fallback runs the {@link ResolveUser} the deployment closed this wrapper over
 * (in production {@link resolveRequestOAuthUser}, which verifies the JWT against
 * JWKS; an instance closes over its env-token resolver instead).

/**
 * Resolve the OAuth bearer on the current request to the calling user.
 *
 * Both infrastructure reads (the signing keys and the user row) mean the token
 * could not be CHECKED, not that it is bad, so the HTTP status is decided by
 * WHICH step failed, not by inspecting error internals:
 *
 *   1. Verify the token against the signing keys. The keys come from
 *      `auth.api.getJwks()` (Better Auth's own JWKS projection, read from the
 *      same database in-process, with no HTTP hop to our own `/auth/jwks`,
 *      which loops back and fails inside a Cloudflare Worker). It is passed as
 *      `jwksFetch` rather than pre-fetched so Better Auth's module-level JWKS
 *      cache serves it: a token whose `kid` is already cached, or a non-JWT
 *      that never decodes far enough to need a key, costs no database read.
 *      `keysUnreadable` carries a key-read failure across that callback
 *      boundary. A verification failure with `keysUnreadable` set is a
 *      retryable 503 (the keys were unreachable, so the token was never
 *      checked); any other verification failure (bad signature, wrong
 *      audience/issuer, expired, malformed, unknown `kid`) is a 401.
 *
 *   2. Look up the subject. A database failure here is again infrastructure
 *      (a retryable 503); a successful query that finds no row is a genuine
 *      401 (the subject was deleted).
 *
 * A 503 matters because returning 401 on an infrastructure fault would make
 * the client discard and refresh a token that may be perfectly good, and pause
 * network auth over a transient server blip.
 *
 * The API origin (`c.var.authBaseURL`) is the resource audience; the same
 * origin plus `/auth` is the issuer. Cheap by design: only the calling user
 * is needed once the token proves issuer, audience, signature, expiration,
 * and subject.
