/**
 * Normalize the auth transport on a WebSocket upgrade.
 *
 * ## Why this exists
 *
 * A browser `new WebSocket(url, protocols)` upgrade is the one request where
 * the client cannot control its own credentials:
 *
 * - It MUST attach the same-origin Better Auth session cookie. There is no
 *   `credentials: 'omit'` for the WebSocket API, so unlike every other
 *   transport in `@epicenter/auth` (all of which already omit it) an upgrade
 *   always carries the ambient cookie.
 * - It CANNOT set `Authorization`. The only channel for an OAuth bearer is
 *   the `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` list, as `bearer.<token>` (see
 *   `@epicenter/sync` `auth-subprotocol.ts`).
 *
 * Rooms is the only WebSocket surface and it is bearer-only
 * ({@link requireBearerPrincipal} never reads the cookie). So on an upgrade the
 * cookie is always ambient noise and the subprotocol bearer is always the
 * intended credential. This middleware makes that structural:
 *
 *   1. Drop the `Cookie`. A WebSocket upgrade is a bearer-only transport in
 *      this product, so the cookie can never authenticate it. Dropping it
 *      unconditionally turns "WS is bearer-only" from a per-route convention
 *      into an invariant a future handler cannot bypass.
 *   2. Lift a single `bearer.<token>` subprotocol entry into
 *      `Authorization: Bearer <token>` so bearer auth sees one canonical
 *      input, and strip it from the echoed subprotocol list. (The Durable
 *      Object also rebuilds a fresh response header set and echoes only the
 *      main `epicenter` subprotocol, so the token never round-trips either
 *      way; stripping here keeps it out of intermediate handlers too.)
 *
 * It never authenticates and never rejects. A missing, empty, or duplicate
 * bearer attaches nothing, and the downstream {@link requireBearerPrincipal}
 * answers 401. Cookie-vs-bearer precedence on ordinary HTTP routes is not
 * this middleware's concern: `requireCookieOrBearerPrincipal` (cookie-first) and
 * `requireBearerPrincipal` (bearer-only) own that, deterministically. Better
 * Auth's `bearer()` plugin is not enabled, so `getSession` reads only the
 * cookie; the OAuth bearer is a separate JWT verified against JWKS. The two
 * credentials are read by disjoint code paths and never merge, so there is
 * no ambiguity to police at the edge.
 *
 * The in-place `c.req.raw` rewrite is Hono's supported header-mutation
 * pattern (used by `methodOverride` and `bodyLimit`): build a fresh
 * `Headers`, construct a new `Request`, reassign.
 *
 * Mount in front of the WebSocket route. Non-upgrade requests pass through
 * untouched.
