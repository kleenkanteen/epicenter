/**
 * Deployment ownership boundary.
 *
 * One middleware that closes the matrix `(rule, URL :ownerId, auth user)`
 * into a resolved owner partition on `c.var.ownerId`:
 *
 *   1. Resolve the owner partition from `(rule, c.var.user)` via
 *      {@link resolveOwnerPartition}. This cannot fail: a per-user request
 *      owns its user's partition, an instance request its pinned constant.
 *   2. If the route declares `:ownerId`, assert the URL segment equals
 *      the resolved partition. Mismatch is 403 OwnerMismatch in every
 *      deployment.
 *   3. Routes without `:ownerId` (the session endpoint) skip the URL
 *      check; the partition still resolves and attaches.
 *
 * Mount AFTER the auth middleware so `c.var.user` is populated.
 * Forgetting the mount on a route that reads `c.var.ownerId` surfaces as
 * a typecheck failure on the missing variable.
