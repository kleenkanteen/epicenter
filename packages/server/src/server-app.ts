/**
 * Server app factory. Wires the portable per-request lifecycle (origin + trust
 * resolution, CORS, CSRF, the rooms registry) and returns a `Hono` instance the
 * deployment mounts every other sub-app on.
 *
 * It takes exactly two things, the two axes a deployment varies on:
 *
 *   - `resolveRooms`: how THIS runtime binds the room registry, the one genuinely
 *     runtime-specific portable concern (a hibernating single-writer actor with no
 *     open standard, ADR-0066 Road 2): a Cloudflare Durable Object, or an in-process
 *     `bun:sqlite` registry. The cloud's Postgres connection and `waitUntil` drain
 *     are NOT runtime concerns of this factory; they are cloud concerns the cloud
 *     installs itself ({@link mountCloudDb}), because only Better Auth and billing
 *     use them. The instance composes neither.
 *   - an {@link Identity}: who THIS deployment is on the web (its canonical origin
 *     and the origins it trusts). These vary per deployment, NOT per runtime:
 *     `apps/api` passes the same identity whether it runs on Workers or Bun.
 *
 * Generic over the context `E`: the cloud composes `createServerApp<CloudEnv>` so
 * it can add db + Better Auth state, the instance composes `createServerApp()`
 * (portable {@link Env}) and the type cannot name a cloud variable.
