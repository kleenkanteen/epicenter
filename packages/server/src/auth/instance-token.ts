/**
 * The single-partition instance's bearer credential (self-host; ADR-0075).
 *
 * A self-hosted instance authenticates one operator-supplied static bearer
 * (`INSTANCE_TOKEN`). The operator generates it once (`gen-token`, backed by
 * `generateInstanceToken` in `@epicenter/auth`), supplies it through the
 * environment, and pastes it into the client's instance setting
 * (`{ baseURL, token }`, ADR-0071). Every request then arrives as
 * `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, and {@link createEnvTokenResolver} is the
 * `ResolveUser` the deployment injects on `createServerApp` to turn that bearer
 * into the instance's principal.
 *
 * This is the VERIFIER side of that credential: it needs `AuthUser`/`ResolveUser`,
 * so it lives in `@epicenter/server`. The pure pieces that need neither (the token
 * generator and the boot entropy gate, `generateInstanceToken` /
 * `assertStrongToken`) live in `@epicenter/auth` so a token can be minted and
 * validated without the server graph.
 *
 * It is a credential SOURCE, not a new auth mode: it feeds the one total gate
 * exactly like `resolveRequestOAuthUser`, and it pairs with `instance` (the
 * pin-to-constant `owners/instance` partition), so the 401 gate, the partition
 * switch, and every owner-scoped route never learn that "self-host" exists. There
 * is no OAuth on an instance; OAuth stays the hosted star's only (ADR-0071).
 *
 * The seam is {@link ResolveUser}, the function `createServerApp` injects (ADR-0066),
 * not a sub-seam beneath it. v1 is one constant-time env-token compare. A future
 * multi-person instance that wants per-token named principals (alice, bob) against
 * the SAME constant partition adds a SIBLING resolver factory beside this one
 * (`createRegistryTokenResolver(registry): ResolveUser`) and injects that instead;
 * nothing here is rewritten, because the injection point is `ResolveUser`, not the
 * compare. That registry is a documented, deliberately-unbuilt seam (ADR-0075):
 * shipping `createEnvTokenResolver` alone is shipping exactly v1, no more.
 *
 * Portable (ADR-0066): nothing here names `node:` or touches disk. The constant-
 * time compare and the token generator both use the Web Crypto `crypto` global,
 * which Bun and Cloudflare Workers expose identically, so the instance runs on
 * either runtime with the operator supplying the secret.
