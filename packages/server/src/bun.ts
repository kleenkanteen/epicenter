/**
 * @epicenter/server/bun: the Bun host surface.
 *
 * Same library, second runtime (ADR-0066). A Bun entry composes its server from
 * here (`createServerApp` + the `mount*` surface) and serves it with `Bun.serve`.
 * The hosted cloud's Bun bootstrap and the instance's Bun bootstrap each own
 * their own composition (`apps/api/server.ts`, `apps/self-host/server.ts`); the
 * library ships the parts, not a shared launcher (ADR-0075/0076). A Bun entry passes
 * {@link createBunRooms}'s `.rooms` as `createServerApp`'s `resolveRooms` (an
 * in-process registry over `bun:sqlite`, not a Durable Object); a cloud-on-Bun entry
 * additionally installs `mountCloudDb` with a `pg.Pool` checkout and a fire-and-forget
 * drain. Bun is the one non-Cloudflare runtime (ADR-0066): `bun:sqlite` is the
 * built-in synchronous engine the room update log needs, and `bun build
 * --compile` is what ships the self-host binary and the Tauri sidecar. There is
 * no Node backend; this code imports `bun:sqlite` and `Bun.serve` directly.
 *
 * This barrel re-exports everything the main barrel does EXCEPT the Cloudflare
 * pieces whose modules name `cloudflare:workers` or a Workers binding and so cannot
 * load in a Bun process: the `Room` Durable Object class, `createDurableObjectRooms`,
 * and `connectHyperdriveDb`. A Bun host supplies its own room and db concerns.
