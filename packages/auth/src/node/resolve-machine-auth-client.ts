/**
 * Resolve the right machine auth client from this node's configuration.
 *
 * The CLI and daemon talk to one of two kinds of star, and the credential model
 * differs by kind (the same fork the browser makes off `Instance.token`):
 *
 *   - a HOSTED star authenticates with a managed OAuth grant the user enrolled
 *     via `epicenter auth login`; it persists (refresh token, access token,
 *     expiry) and refreshes itself. That cell is loaded by
 *     {@link createMachineAuthClient}.
 *   - a SELF-HOSTED star authenticates with a static instance bearer token. A
 *     static token has no refresh lifecycle, so its home is configuration, not a
 *     persisted credential store: it is supplied non-interactively through
 *     `EPICENTER_TOKEN` (or `EPICENTER_TOKEN_FILE`) and consumed by
 *     {@link createInstanceTokenAuth}. It is never written to disk.
 *
 * This is the single choke point both consumers (`epicenter daemon up`,
 * `epicenter blobs`) call so neither re-implements the fork. The rule: a
 * configured static token wins and selects the instance-token client; otherwise
 * fall back to the persisted OAuth cell.
 *
 * See `specs/20260625T132139-cli-and-headless-credential-seam-for-self-host.md`.
