/**
 * The single-partition instance bearer secret: generate one, and gate one at
 * boot (self-host; ADR-0075).
 *
 * A self-hosted instance authenticates one operator-supplied static bearer
 * (`INSTANCE_TOKEN`). These are the two PURE pieces of that credential, the ones
 * with no server coupling: {@link generateInstanceToken} mints a strong token and
 * {@link assertStrongToken} is the boot entropy gate. They live in `@epicenter/auth`
 * (not `@epicenter/server`) so a token can be generated and validated without
 * dragging the server graph in: the CLI and the self-host scripts depend on
 * `@epicenter/auth`, not `@epicenter/server`.
 *
 * The matching RESOLVER side (turn a presented bearer into a principal, the
 * `ResolvePrincipal` a deployment injects) needs the server's `Principal` and
 * `ResolvePrincipal` types, so it stays in `@epicenter/server`.
 * `createEnvTokenResolver` resolves any exact-match bearer to
 * `{ id: INSTANCE_PRINCIPAL_ID }`.
 *
 * Portable (ADR-0066): nothing here names `node:` or touches disk. The token
 * generator uses the Web Crypto `crypto` global (`getRandomValues`, `btoa`), which
 * Bun and Cloudflare Workers expose identically, so the same helper runs in a
 * `gen-token` script and in any runtime.

 * emits 43 chars (256 bits), comfortably above the floor. An earlier minting
 * design guaranteed 256 bits implicitly; with the operator supplying the secret
 * instead, this gate keeps a fat-fingered `letmein` from silently becoming the
