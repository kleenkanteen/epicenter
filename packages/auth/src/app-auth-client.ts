/**
 * The one client-side choke point that turns a persisted {@link Instance} into a
 * concrete auth client, mirroring `createMachineAuthClient` on the node side.
 *
 * The persisted instance is the only branch, and it is a clean two-state value
 * (ADR-0070/0071):
 *
 * - A `token` means a self-hosted star: authenticate with the static bearer the
 *   box minted ({@link createInstanceTokenAuth}); no OAuth flow, launcher, or
 *   persisted grant.
 * - No `token` means the hosted default: run OAuth ({@link createOAuthAppAuth})
 *   against the hosted star with the app's hosted-constant launcher. The
 *   {@link InstanceSetting} guarantees a no-token instance carries the hosted
 *   base URL, so OAuth never targets a self-hosted origin.
 *
 * Both branches return a {@link SyncAuthClient}, so the result is a drop-in for
 * principal-scoped cloud sync regardless of which credential model was chosen.
 * There is no persisted mode tag: the credential model is recomputed from the
 * instance at construction, not stored as a discriminator. The chosen branch is
 * recorded once on the client as `deployment.kind`, which is what UI branches
 * on; nothing downstream re-derives the mode from the persisted instance.
