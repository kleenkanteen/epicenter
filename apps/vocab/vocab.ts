 * Vocab workspace contract: id, branded types, tables, kv, and the workspace

 *
 * Distribution: this file is the `@epicenter/vocab` package root file
 * (the target of the package's `"."` export). The browser entrypoint imports the
 * schema from here and composes runtime-specific attachments around it. The table
 * and KV shapes here are the wire contract for sync; forking a column shape
 * breaks sync compatibility with peers running the canonical schema.
 *
 * Composition lives elsewhere:
 *  - `apps/vocab/vocab.browser.ts`
 *      → `openVocabBrowser({ auth, nodeId })`

Guidelines:
- Use English for explanations, transitions, and meta-commentary.
- Use the language being studied for vocabulary, example sentences, and conversational phrases.
- Write plain text only. Never add pronunciation guides, phonetic readings, or romanization (no pinyin, romaji, or transliteration): the client renders readings above the text automatically.
- When teaching vocabulary, present the studied-language word naturally inline inside an English sentence, e.g. "The word for 'to study' is used like this: ...".
- For example sentences, write them in the studied language, then explain in English.
- Adjust difficulty based on context clues from the user's questions.
- Be conversational and encouraging.`;
