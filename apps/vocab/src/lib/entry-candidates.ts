/**
 * Entry candidates: propose savable spans from one settled assistant message.
 *
 * The sibling of {@link buildPracticePrompt} on the read side. Where Practice
 * compiles saved entries into a passage, this asks the model to extract notable
 * spans from a passage the user just read, so a whole answer can be triaged into
 * the entry pool without dragging a selection over each phrase. Its reason to
 * exist is spans a local segmenter cannot reach (multi-character phrases,
 * chengyu), which is exactly why ADR-0102 retired tap-capture.
 *
 * Nothing here is persisted. The model's output is transient: it becomes a list
 * of candidate strings the user chooses from, and only the chosen `text` flows
 * through the one entry writer (`entriesState.save`). No gloss, no meaning, no
 * provenance, no language, and no candidate metadata is ever stored (ADR-0102).
 *
 * Deliberately language-neutral, like {@link buildPracticePrompt}: it names no
 * target or source language and lets the tutor persona own which language is
 * being taught. In a bilingual passage that means "extract the studied-language
 * spans, not the explanatory glue", which the model resolves from the passage
 * itself, so this path holds no language-specific strings.

/**
 * The system prompt for an entry-candidate extraction request. The passage to read
 * is sent as the user turn (see `complete`), so this takes no argument: it is
 * the fixed instruction that turns any passage into a bare, one-span-per-line
 * list.
 *
 * It asks for spans only, no glosses, because the meaning lives in the chat the
 * span came from, never in a stored definition (ADR-0102). The parser
 * ({@link parseEntryCandidates}) recovers spans even when the model disobeys and
 * adds numbering or a gloss anyway, so this stays a request, not a contract.
