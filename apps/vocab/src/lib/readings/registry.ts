/**
 * The reading overlay: a small ordered registry of deterministic, per-script
 * romanizers (ADR-0104).
 *
 * A reading (pinyin over Han, romaji over kana, ...) is a client-side derived
 * view over clean message text: the tutor writes plain prose, the message is
 * stored and fed back to the model verbatim, and readings are rendered on top
 * through the `Romanizer`/`Segment`/`<ruby>` seam in `@epicenter/ui/markdown`.
 * Each provider owns one script, is pure and synchronous, and is lazily loaded
 * the first time that script is actually read, so a language's dictionary is
 * fetched (a code-split import, browser-cached) only on demand.
 *
 * Deterministic by design: no model call, no network, no round-trip validation,
 * no non-determinism. That is only possible for scripts whose orthography
 * carries the reading, either phonemically (alphabets like Cyrillic and Greek,
 * the kana syllabary, the Hangul featural alphabet) or lexically (Han, via a
 * per-character pinyin dictionary). Scripts that under-specify pronunciation
 * (abjads like Arabic and Hebrew hide vowels; Devanagari hides schwa deletion;
 * Thai hides word boundaries and tone) have no useful deterministic romanizer
 * and get no automatic reading; the tutor's prose can still explain the sound.

 *
 * To add a language: write a `ReadingProvider` (a small romanizer plus a script
 * test) and add it here. Committed short list, all deterministic, pure-JS, and
 * free of any runtime dictionary download: Chinese, Japanese kana, and Cyrillic
 * are shipped. Korean and Greek were evaluated as cheap adds and deferred: no
 * lightweight package clears the "a wrong reading is worse than none" bar
 * (Korean RR needs cross-syllable assimilation the small packages get wrong;
 * Greek γ is unreliable in every phonetic library tried). Japanese kanji
 * (kuroshiro + kuromoji, ~12MB dict) is deferred as the heavy case. See ADR-0104
 * for the per-script reasoning. An AI-annotation provider for under-specifying
 * scripts is a deliberately refused, earned-later entry: it would be the only
