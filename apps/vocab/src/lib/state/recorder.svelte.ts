/**
 * A minimal web audio recorder: open the mic, capture to memory, and hand back
 * one {@link Blob} on stop. The whole capability dictation needs, nothing more
 * (no levels, no pause/resume, no device picker).
 *
 * Deliberately not a shared `@epicenter/recorder` package and deliberately not
 * imported from Whispering. Vocab is the only consumer today, and Whispering's
 * recorder is an app, not a capability; importing it would couple to the app, not
 * the capability. When a second app wants recording, extract it then, the same
 * call the spec made for the transcribe client.
 *
 * Result-typed and never-throwing: a denied mic or a capture fault comes back as
 * a {@link RecorderError}, which the caller surfaces at its toast layer.
