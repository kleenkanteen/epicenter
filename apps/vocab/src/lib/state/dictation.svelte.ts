/**
 * Vocab dictation: a continuous voice-activity-detection session over
 * `@epicenter/recorder`. The package owns the microphone and utterance
 * segmentation (Silero VAD; assets served from `/vad/`, see vite.config.ts);
 * this controller owns the UI-facing cycle: it mirrors the session into a
 * reactive status and transcribes each spoken phrase through the shared
 * `transcribe` client. One device-wide singleton, because there is one mic.
 *
 * A session is tap-to-open, tap-to-close. Inside it, every pause-delimited
 * phrase becomes one transcription handed to `onTranscript` as a `Result`; the
 * caller routes text into its input and errors to its toast layer. A failed
 * phrase does not end the session.
 *
 * Transcription is a stateless service (the spec's star/service/library model):
 * this holds no preferences and reaches for no sync. It pulls only the device
 * connection registry and Vocab's own app-local model constant.
 *
 * The transport comes from `resolveOrHosted(VOCAB_STT_MODEL)`, the same predicate
 * chat uses. `whisper-1` is not in Vocab's hosted *chat* catalog, so nothing
 * "serves" it and the call falls back to the hosted transport: the STT gateway on
 * the same `<origin>/v1` Connection base, zero setup, metered. A user who added
 * their own OpenAI key that serves `whisper-1` dictates through that key instead,
 * off Epicenter credits, exactly like a custom chat model resolves first. So the
 * honest path is the registry's, not a hosted transport rebuilt here.
