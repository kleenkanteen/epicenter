/**
 * Vocab dictation: record a phrase, transcribe it through the OpenAI-compatible
 * speech-to-text wire, and hand back the text. One device-wide singleton (there
 * is one mic), composed from the minimal {@link createRecorder} and the shared
 * `transcribe` client.
 *
 * Transcription is a stateless service (the spec's star/service/library model):
 * this holds no preferences and reaches for no sync. It pulls only the device
 * connection registry and Vocab's own app-local model + language constants.
 *
 * The transport comes from `resolveOrHosted(VOCAB_STT_MODEL)`, the same predicate
 * chat uses. `whisper-1` is not in Vocab's hosted *chat* catalog, so nothing
 * "serves" it and the call falls back to the hosted transport: the STT gateway on
 * the same `<origin>/v1` Connection base, zero setup, metered. A user who added
 * their own OpenAI key that serves `whisper-1` dictates through that key instead,
 * off Epicenter credits, exactly like a custom chat model resolves first. So the
 * honest path is the registry's, not a hosted transport rebuilt here.
