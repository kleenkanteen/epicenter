/**
 * Structured error variants for the loopback `/api` surface of `local-books app`.
 *
 * Every non-2xx response from the Hono app ({@link api.ts}, its only emitter)
 * comes from one of these variants, so the wire shape is `wellcrafted`'s
 * envelope `{ data: null, error: { name, message, status } }` and each variant
 * bakes in its own HTTP `status`. Emit as `c.json(err, err.error.status)`; the
 * `c-json-errors` biome gate is satisfied because a factory result is not an
 * inline object literal.
 *
 * The one consumer is the same-origin SPA, which surfaces `error.message` in a
 * toast; it does not branch on `error.name`. The variants exist to keep the
 * error surface centralized and typed, not because a remote client reads them.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * import { ApiError } from './api-errors.ts';
 * const err = ApiError.RowNotFound();
 * return c.json(err, err.error.status); // 404
 * ```
