/**
 * `queryBooks`: read-only SQL over the local QuickBooks mirror. The `query` CLI
 * verb is a thin adapter over this; an off-the-shelf coding agent pointed at
 * `books.db` is the other consumer. The data leaves the machine only as the rows
 * this returns, the egress ADR-0033 already accepts.
 *
 * Read-only is enforced by the connection, not a string check:
 * `new Database(path, { readonly: true })` makes SQLite reject every write
 * statement, so even arbitrary SQL cannot mutate the mirror. Results are
 * row-capped so a broad query cannot flood a caller (or a model's context).
 *
 * This core is the seam ADR-0072 leaves open: a future daemon re-exposes it with
 * `defineQuery({ handler: queryBooks })` without changing this function.

 * Run a read-only SQL query against the mirror at `dbPath`. The handle is opened

 *
 * Rows are pulled lazily and the read STOPS at the cap: a query reads at most
 * `MAX_ROWS + 1` rows, never the full result set. This is what makes the cap a
 * real bound rather than cosmetic, since the caller is often an untrusted model:
 * a recursive CTE, a cartesian product, or any huge result set cannot
 * materialize an unbounded array and exhaust memory. The read-only connection
 * still rejects every write statement (the integrity boundary). A single
 * enormous value or a pure-CPU query is out of scope of the row cap.
