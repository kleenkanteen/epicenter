 *
 * CDC is a high-water-mark protocol: `changedSince` is a single timestamp for a
 * multi-entity call. So the mirror keeps ONE cursor for the whole company, not
 * one per entity, stored in `_meta` (`cdc_cursor`, `last_full_pull_at`,
 * `last_synced_at`). "Has this entity had its first full pull?" is answered by
 * whether its table exists, so there is no per-entity sync-state table: the
 * tables themselves are the initialization latch. The cursor advances in the
 * same transaction as the rows it accounts for (see `ingest`), so
 * ingest-and-advance is atomic and crash-safe.
 *
 * The realm owns its identity through the path (`<dataDir>/<realmId>/books.db`),
 * not a stored column, so the db need not know which company it holds.
