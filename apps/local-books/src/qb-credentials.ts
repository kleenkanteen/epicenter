/**
 * QuickBooks provider-credential spec (ADR-0108), app-owned. QuickBooks issues a
 * whole distinct OAuth keyset per environment (Intuit's Development vs Production
 * apps register different redirect URIs and client ids), so both roles vary per
 * account and are environment-qualified:
 *
 *   QB_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID     / QB_SANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET      (Development keyset)
 *   QB_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_ID  / QB_PRODUCTION_CLIENT_SECRET   (Production keyset)
 *
 * The old undifferentiated `QB_CLIENT_ID` / `QB_CLIENT_SECRET` are retired: the
 * `--qb-env` flag now picks the keyset by name, so the wrong vault environment
 * can no longer substitute the wrong account's key. Which Infisical (or Wrangler)
 * environment stores a given qualified name is an orthogonal access-control
 * choice; the name, not the injection path, is the selector.

 * several calls later (the 2026-07-03 incident behind ADR-0108).
