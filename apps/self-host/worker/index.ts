/**
 * Epicenter self-hosted shared-wiki Worker (reference implementation).
 *
 * Composes `@epicenter/server` with the `shared({ admit })` ownership rule
 * and ships zero billing surface. Workspace data is partitioned under the
 * literal `SHARED_OWNER_ID` ("shared"); the admit predicate runs per request
 * against a deployment-owned email allowlist.
 *
 * This is a reference, not an Epicenter-operated product. Copy this folder,
 * fill in the deployment-owned secrets (Better Auth, OAuth provider keys,
 * AI provider keys), provision your Cloudflare bindings (Hyperdrive, R2, KV,
 * Durable Objects), and deploy. Community-supported.
 *
 * Trust boundary: the deployer operates the infrastructure. Epicenter never
 * holds or sees the data stored here, so self-hosting is functionally
 * zero-knowledge against Epicenter.
