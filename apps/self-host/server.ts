/**
 * Bun entry for apps/self-host: the shared-wiki deployable, off Cloudflare.
 *
 * The off-Cloudflare twin of `worker/index.ts`. It builds the SAME
 * `createServerApp(...)` the Worker builds, but binds the per-concern runtime
 * hooks to plain primitives instead of Cloudflare bindings (ADR-0066):
 *
 *   - `connectDb`     a module-scope `pg.Pool` over `DATABASE_URL`
 *   - `afterResponse` fire-and-forget in the live process (no `waitUntil`)
 *   - `resolveRooms`  an in-process registry over `bun:sqlite` files
 *
 * This is the "one binary + Postgres, no Cloudflare account" self-host artifact:
 * `bun server.ts` (or a `bun build --compile` binary) is a complete shared wiki
 * on a single box. Rooms are `bun:sqlite` files on local disk, so this is a
 * single-node deployment by design: it does not shard or hibernate per room the
 * way the Durable Object edge does, which is exactly right for one community's
 * wiki and the price of owning your own data on your own machine.
 *
 * Ownership is `shared({ admit })`: every authenticated user shares the literal
 * SHARED_OWNER_ID partition, gated by an email allowlist this host parses ONCE
 * at boot from `ALLOWED_MEMBER_EMAILS`. Unlike the Worker (which reads the
 * allowlist off its own `Cloudflare.Env` per request), boot validation lets this
 * entry resolve the set once and close over it, so admit names no Cloudflare
 * type and never re-parses.
 *
 * Surface mirrors the Worker self-host: session + rooms + inference, zero
 * billing, no dashboard SPA. Blobs are intentionally not mounted; add
 * `mountBlobsApp` with `BLOBS_S3_*` set to offer a content-addressed media store
 * against any S3 (proven portable on Bun by the apps/api runtime-parity smoke).
 *
 * The wiring lives in {@link startSelfHostServer} so `server.dev.ts` can boot the
 * SAME server with a dev `resolveUser` injected (the smoke's credential) without
 * duplicating it. Production runs only when this file IS the entrypoint
 * (`import.meta.main`), so `server.dev.ts` importing the builder does not start a
 * second listener. Production passes no `resolveUser` and keeps the real OAuth
 * resolver; this file never imports the dev bypass.
