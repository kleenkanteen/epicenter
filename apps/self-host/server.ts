/**
 * Bun entry for apps/self-host: the single-partition instance (ADR-0075).
 *
 * The off-Cloudflare twin of `worker/index.ts`, and the instance's peer to the
 * hosted cloud's own Bun bootstrap (`apps/api/server.ts`). Each Bun entry owns
 * its composition rather than sharing a launcher: this one is bearer-only with no
 * relational-auth substrate (no Better Auth, no cookie sessions), so a shared
 * factory would re-introduce the mode knob ADR-0075/0076 deleted. It composes no
 * Postgres (no Better Auth, no telemetry), so its
 * runtime adapter (ADR-0066) provides only one leg:
 *
 *   - `resolveRooms`  an in-process registry over `bun:sqlite` files
 *
 * This is the "one binary, no Cloudflare account, no database" instance artifact:
 * `bun server.ts` (or a `bun build --compile` binary) is a complete box on a
 * single node. Rooms are `bun:sqlite` files on local disk, so this is a single-node
 * deployment by design: it does not shard or hibernate per room the way the
 * Durable Object edge does, which is exactly right for one homelab, one family, or
 * one small team and the price of owning your own data on your own machine.
 *
 * There is ONE shape, not a mode (ADR-0075). Every request resolves to the pinned
 * `principals/instance` partition. Authentication is one operator-supplied static bearer
 * (`INSTANCE_TOKEN`), constant-time compared. "Solo" and "shared" are not
 * configurations: they are only how many people you hand the one token to. No
 * OAuth, no sessions, no allowlist, no mode, no first-boot minting. Multi-tenant
 * per-user partitions are Epicenter Cloud's, never an instance's.
 *
 * Boot FAILS CLOSED if `INSTANCE_TOKEN` is missing or fails the entropy gate, with
 * an error that points at `gen-token`: the operator generates the token once
 * (`bun run gen-token`) and supplies it through the environment, never a file the
 * box mints. That gate replaces the 256-bit floor minting used to guarantee while
 * keeping the instance Bun-or-Cloudflare (the operator supplies the secret either
 * way).
 *
 * Surface: session + rooms + inference + blobs behind one bearer, zero billing,
 * no dashboard SPA, no auth surface. The blob store is a portable
 * content-addressed media store over any S3 (your own MinIO/Garage/R2); it is
 * mounted by default and answers 503 until `BLOBS_S3_*` is set, exactly as the
 * inference gateway answers 503 until a provider house key is set. Owning your
 * own media on your own bucket is squarely the instance's purpose; configure
 * `BLOBS_S3_*` to turn it on, or leave it unconfigured to run without object
 * storage.
