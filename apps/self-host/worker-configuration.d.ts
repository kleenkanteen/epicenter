/**
 * Cloudflare bindings for apps/self-host.
 *
 * Hand-written so this reference deployable typechecks without requiring a
 * Cloudflare account or a `wrangler types` run. The library's binding
 * contract is inherited from `ServerBindings`, so this file declares only
 * what the deployment itself owns. If you replace it with `wrangler types`
 * output, re-add the `extends` clause so the inherited bindings (the optional
 * OAuth keys and AI provider house keys) survive the regeneration.
 *
 * Hosted-only bindings (Autumn, ASSETS, ADMIN_USER_IDS) are deliberately
 * absent: the instance reference has no billing surface and no dashboard SPA.
