/**
 * Dev-only credential bypass for the runtime-parity smoke.
 *
 * `Authorization: Bearer dev:<principalId>` resolves to the principal
 * `{ id: <principalId>, email: <principalId>@dev.invalid }` with no interactive
 * login.
 * The fabricated email is allowed here because dev auth simulates Cloud, where
 * Better Auth always supplies an email; instance principals have none.
 * It exists so `apps/api/scripts/smoke.ts` (and CI) can drive the authed
 * surfaces without Google OAuth or a forged Better Auth session, which is the
 * only thing that scenario cannot obtain over plain HTTP.
 *
 * This IS a bypass, so it is quarantined: it is wired ONLY by `server.dev.ts`,
 * which the production entrypoints (`worker/index.ts`, `server.ts`) never
 * import, so it cannot ship. It is a `ResolveBearerPrincipal` injected on
 * `createServerApp`, never an env-gated branch inside `@epicenter/server` (that
 * would compile the bypass into production). Belt-and-suspenders: it refuses
 * unless the request landed on localhost, so even a misconfigured deploy that
 * somehow wired it would admit nobody off-box.
 *
 * The resolved `id` is the partition directly, so the smoke needs no seeded user
 * and no database access of its own.
