/**
 * Epicenter Cloud Worker entry.
 *
 * Composes `@epicenter/server` with the `personal` ownership rule and
 * layers cloud-only billing, admin, and dashboard surfaces on top.
 * Self-hosted shared-wiki deployments live in a sibling apps/* folder and
 * compose the same library with `shared({ admit })` and no Autumn
 * policies.
 *
 * Read top to bottom for the full URL surface of cloud. Each `mount*`
 * call bundles the auth + ownership + policies + route mount for one
 * reusable surface; the deployment passes only the deployment-controlled
 * knobs (ownership rule, optional cloud policies, auth choice for AI).
