/**
 * Epicenter Cloud Worker entry.
 *
 * Composes `@epicenter/server` with the cloud principal resolver and layers
 * cloud-only billing and dashboard surfaces on top.
 * The self-hosted single-partition instance lives in a sibling apps/* folder
 * and composes the same library with `instance` and no Autumn policies
 * (ADR-0075).
 *
 * Read top to bottom for the full URL surface of cloud. Each `mount*`
 * call bundles auth + policies + route mount for one
 * reusable surface; the deployment passes only the deployment-controlled
 * knobs (optional cloud policies, auth choice for AI).
