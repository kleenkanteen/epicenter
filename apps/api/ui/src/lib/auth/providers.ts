/**
 * The social providers the hosted sign-in and account pages offer.
 *
 * One authoritative record, provider id to display label; the id union and the
 * ordered list derive from it, so adding a provider is a single line here.
 *
 * This is a static list, not a server-driven one: Epicenter's hosted cloud
 * always configures all three, and this UI only ever runs in that hosted cloud
 * (a self-hosted instance uses operator-bearer auth and composes no social
 * sign-in at all). The server is still the real guard, `createAuth` registers
 * only the providers it has secrets for, so Better Auth rejects a sign-in for
 * an unconfigured provider at the call. Hiding a button would only be UX polish,
 * and it cost a bespoke `/sign-in/context` endpoint plus a hand-mirrored wire
 * type; both are gone. A hosted env missing a provider's secrets (e.g. Apple in
 * local dev) shows a button that errors on click instead.
