/**
 * Bun entry for apps/api: the runtime port's keystone second runtime.
 *
 * Builds the SAME `createServerApp(...)` the Cloudflare Worker builds
 * (`worker/index.ts`), but binds the per-concern runtime hooks to plain
 * primitives instead of Cloudflare bindings (ADR-0066):
 *
 *   - the `db` leg   a module-scope `pg.Pool` over `DATABASE_URL`, drained
 *                    fire-and-forget in the live process (no `waitUntil`)
 *   - `resolveRooms` an in-process registry over `bun:sqlite` files
 *   - blobs          any S3 endpoint via the existing `BLOBS_S3_*` env
 *
 * This is additive: `wrangler dev`/`deploy` still serve the Worker unchanged.
 * `bun --watch server.ts` boots instantly with real stack traces. It is the
 * hosted cloud on Bun (local dev and the runtime-parity smoke), NOT the self-host
 * artifact: the single-partition instance has its own entry
 * (`apps/self-host/server.ts`), composing no Better Auth and no Postgres (ADR-0075).
 *
 * The whole hosted-cloud-on-Bun bootstrap lives here, in the app, not behind a
 * shared `@epicenter/server` factory: everything mechanical (the `pg.Pool`, the
 * `bun:sqlite` rooms, the cloud auth layer, the session/rooms/inference/blobs
 * mounts, `Bun.serve`) is this app's composition to own. The instance does NOT
 * share it (it diverges on the substrate that matters: no Better Auth, no
 * Postgres), so a shared launcher would re-introduce the mode knob ADR-0075/0076
 * deleted. The library ships the parts; each Bun entry composes its own product.
 *
 * The wiring lives in {@link startBunApiServer} so `server.dev.ts` can boot the
 * SAME server with a dev `resolvePrincipal` injected (the parity smoke's credential)
 * without duplicating it. The bottom of this file runs production only when this
 * file IS the entrypoint (`import.meta.main`), so `server.dev.ts` importing the
 * builder does not also start a second listener. Production passes no
 * `resolvePrincipal` and keeps the real OAuth resolver; this file never imports the
 * dev bypass.
 *
 * Runtime skew is fenced by design: a DO-only behavior (hibernation restore,
 * alarm timing, edge placement) will not surface here, so `wrangler dev` /
 * staging stays the fidelity gate before any deploy touching room behavior.
 *
 * The dashboard SPA and billing data plane are intentionally omitted: Vite
 * serves the dashboard in dev, and billing is the hosted Worker's concern.
