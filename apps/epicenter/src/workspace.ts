/**
 * The Query workspace: the host's own durable data, today just the
 * canonical conversations table (ADR-0055). The host connects it with
 * `connect(null, { persistence })` beside the built-in app replicas, so
 * transcripts are durable on this machine but never reach a relay; sync is a
 * deliberate later wave that arrives with host sign-in.
 *
 * Exported so tests (and later waves) can open a second replica over the same
 * data directory and read what the host wrote.
