/**
 * The focused (in-app) shortcut backend: shortcuts that fire while the Whispering
 * window is focused, driven by the browser keydown matcher and stored in workspace
 * KV under `shortcut.*` as the structured `KeyBinding` the matcher and the system
 * tier already speak (via `field.json`; the global tier stores the same shape in
 * device-config). Read and written directly, with no string codec in between. A
 * stale value (a binding saved before this format) fails the cell's schema check
 * on read and falls back to the default.
 *
 * Universal, not a `#platform` seam: the webview matcher runs in the Tauri window
 * too, so this same backend is the focused half on every platform. The reach
 * router (`shortcuts.ts`) composes it with the Tauri-only `systemShortcuts`; on
 * desktop both run, on web this is the only one. See ADR-0052.
