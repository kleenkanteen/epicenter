 * The per-account sync-owner lock. The runtime invariant is: at most one active
 * sync owner per account. Only the sync path takes this lock; reads
 * (`query`/`status`) open the mirror read-only, and triage writes go Gmail-first
 * with a best-effort local fold, so neither needs it. The holders are the open
 * desktop `app` (holds it for its whole lifetime while the loop runs), a CLI
 * `sync --watch` loop, and a one-shot `sync` for the duration of its single pass.
 *
 * A dedicated `lock.db` held with `BEGIN EXCLUSIVE` is the lock: a second holder
 * fails to open the transaction instantly (`busy_timeout = 0`) and yields rather
 * than racing a second bulk pull. `flock` has no Bun API and an `O_EXCL` lockfile
 * is stale-on-crash; the fcntl lock a live SQLite transaction holds is released
 * by the kernel on `kill -9`, so a crashed owner never wedges the next sync.
 * SQLite tracks open connections per process, so this also refuses a second
 * in-process holder, not just a second process.
