//! The Local Mail desktop shell.
//!
//! This shell is the smallest native wrapper around the existing Bun mail
//! engine (`local-mail app`). It owns exactly two things: the window, and the
//! lifetime of the child engine process. It does NOT own Gmail OAuth, token
//! refresh, sync, the SQLite mirror, or the loopback API bearer; those all stay
//! in Bun end to end (ADR-0116). The engine already serves the triage SPA and a
//! same-origin `/api` on `127.0.0.1` and injects the per-launch bearer into the
//! HTML it serves, so the shell only has to point a webview at that origin.
//!
//! Startup, end to end (the ADR-0084 sidecar recipe):
//!
//! 1. `setup()` spawns `bun src/bin.ts app` from the engine's package dir.
//! 2. The engine prints exactly one line to stdout, the loopback origin it now
//!    serves (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>`), and prints it only after the server
//!    is listening. That line is both the discovery signal (which port) and the
//!    readiness signal (it is up), so no separate health poll is needed.
//! 3. On that line, the shell opens a `WebviewUrl::External` window at the
//!    origin. Tauri does not inject its CSP into external pages, so the engine's
//!    own response headers (frame-deny, `no-store`, CSP) remain the security
//!    boundary; the shell adds nothing and subtracts nothing.
//! 4. On app exit (Cmd+Q, or closing the window), the shell kills the engine so
//!    it never outlives the window. ADR-0116: the mirror syncs only while the
//!    app is open; there is no background mail service.
//!
//! The webview never calls `invoke()` (it talks only to its own same-origin
//! `/api` over HTTP), so the shell registers no commands and needs no remote-IPC
//! allowlist. The bearer never transits Rust.
