# local-mail desktop shell

The smallest native wrapper around the Bun mail engine (`local-mail app`). It
owns the window and the child engine's lifetime, and nothing else. Gmail OAuth,
token refresh, sync, the SQLite mirror, and the loopback API bearer all stay in
Bun end to end (ADR-0116). Rust never sees a Gmail token or the bearer.

## How it works

1. `setup()` spawns `bun src/bin.ts app` from the engine package dir.
2. The engine prints the loopback origin it serves (`http://127.0.0.1:<port>`)
   to stdout, once, only after it is listening. That single line is both the
   discovery signal (which port) and the readiness signal (it is up).
3. The shell opens a `WebviewUrl::External` window at that origin. The engine's
   own response headers (frame-deny, `no-store`, CSP) are the security boundary;
   Tauri does not inject CSP into external pages, and the webview never calls
   `invoke()`, so the shell registers no commands and needs no remote-IPC
   allowlist.
4. Closing the window quits the app, which kills the engine (`RunEvent::Exit`).
   The engine never outlives the window: no background mail service (ADR-0116).

This is the ADR-0084 sidecar recipe (spawn the engine, read the port from
stdout, point a window at it), the pattern that spec named for the Tauri wrap.

## Run it (dev)

Prerequisites: `bun` on PATH, and the UI built once so the engine has something
to serve:

```sh
bun run --cwd apps/local-mail/ui build
```

Then, from `apps/local-mail`:

```sh
bun run app:desktop      # == tauri dev: cargo runs the shell, which spawns the engine
```

A connected account is required (`bun run src/bin.ts connect` once). The shell
opens no window until the engine reports its origin, so a blank moment at launch
is the engine starting, not a hang. Watch the terminal for `[sync ...]` and the
`listening on http://127.0.0.1:...` hint.

Only `bun` is called: no port is pinned, so this never collides with a separate
`local-mail app` you already have open (that instance keeps the sync lock; this
one serves reads, both under their own ephemeral origins).

## Build a desktop bundle

```sh
bun run desktop:build      # == tauri build, targets the macOS .app
```

`beforeBuildCommand` runs `bun run build:desktop` first, which builds the SPA
(`ui/dist`) and compiles the engine sidecar
(`src-tauri/binaries/local-mail-engine-<target-triple>`, a `bun build --compile`
binary, ~60MB). Tauri then bundles both into
`src-tauri/target/release/bundle/macos/Local Mail.app`.

How the packaged app differs from `tauri dev`:

- **The engine is a compiled sidecar, not `bun src/bin.ts`.** A packaged app has
  no repo beside it and `bun` may be absent from the user's PATH (ADR-0116 keeps
  the whole mail engine in Bun, so it ships as one binary). `bundle.externalBin`
  registers `binaries/local-mail-engine`; Tauri strips the target-triple suffix
  and copies it into `Contents/MacOS/local-mail-engine`. `engine_command` branches
  on `cfg!(debug_assertions)`: dev spawns `bun src/bin.ts app`; release resolves
  `current_exe().parent()/local-mail-engine`.
- **The SPA is a bundled resource, not a source sibling.** A `bun build --compile`
  binary's `import.meta.dir` is a virtual path with no `ui/dist` beside it, so
  the SPA ships via `bundle.resources` (`../ui/dist` -> `Contents/Resources/ui-dist`)
  and the shell passes `LOCAL_MAIL_UI_DIST` (resolved from `resource_dir()`) when
  it spawns the sidecar. The engine's serving code is identical to dev; only the
  root path differs. Same `app` entrypoint, same loopback contract.

Rust still owns only the window and the child's lifetime. The sidecar is the
same Bun engine; no Gmail token, sync, mirror, or bearer transits Rust
(ADR-0116).

## Signing and notarization (the one deferred item)

The produced `.app` is **unsigned** (ad-hoc). That is fine for a locally built
app run on the same machine: it is not quarantined, so Gatekeeper does not block
it. It is not distributable as-is; a downloaded copy would be quarantined and
refused without a right-click-open.

To sign and notarize, no code changes are needed, only credentials and config:

1. An Apple Developer ID Application certificate in the login keychain.
2. `bundle.macOS.signingIdentity` set (or the `APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY` env var),
   plus `bundle.macOS.hardenedRuntime: true` and an entitlements file if any
   hardened-runtime exceptions are needed.
3. Notarization credentials (`APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_PASSWORD`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`) so
   `tauri build` can staple the notarization ticket.

Blocker, not a design gap: this machine has no Apple Developer credentials
configured, so the wave ships an unsigned local bundle and leaves the signing
config to whoever holds the certificate. Crib `apps/honeycrisp` for the
hardened-runtime block.

## Deferred niceties (not correctness gates)

- **Graceful engine shutdown.** Exit kills the engine with SIGKILL, which is
  safe by design (the sync lock is a kernel-released fcntl lock; presence is
  stale-safe). A SIGINT/SIGTERM path (so the engine clears its presence file and
  releases the lock cleanly) is a nice-to-have.
- **Orphan on hard kill.** If the app is SIGKILLed, the engine is reparented and
  keeps running (holding the sync lock). Harmless and self-healing (the lock is
  crash-safe; the next launch or a manual `kill` clears it), but worth a
  parent-death watchdog if it ever bites.
