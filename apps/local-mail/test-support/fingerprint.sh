# Fingerprint the REAL Local Mail mirror's durable state, to prove a write test
# never touched it. Hashes only the durable files: `credentials.json` and each
# account's `mail.db`. The volatile `-wal`/`-shm`/`lock.db` sidecars are skipped
# on purpose: SQLite rewrites them during any open, so they are noise, not signal.
#
# Usage:
#   fingerprint.sh > before.txt      # capture before a write test
#   ...run the harness / smoke...
#   diff before.txt <(fingerprint.sh)  # must be empty
#
# Env overrides:
#   LOCAL_MAIL_REAL_DIR   mirror to hash (default: macOS Application Support dir)
