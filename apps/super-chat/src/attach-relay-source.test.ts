/**
 * AttachRelay source plane and desktop-offline behavior (ADR-0115 wave 6).
 *
 * The wave's product sentence: a phone attached to the desktop Super Chat
 * session can ask a question that uses a desktop-local read-only source, receive
 * the streamed answer over the trusted relay, and later see the finished
 * transcript even when the desktop is offline; it cannot start a new local-source
 * question while the desktop is unreachable.
 *
 * These run on the same authenticated self-host mount as wave 3. What they pin:
 *
 * - A remote client drives a turn that reads a host-local read-only source
 *   (`imessage__search`), the answer streams back, and the source content really
 *   flowed through the session. The trusted relay may see live frame payloads;
 *   the important boundary is that it still routes only endpoint-addressed
 *   frames and never exposes a source route or capability.
 * - The finished transcript is durable in the host's own workspace and reads from
 *   a fresh replica after the desktop process is gone: this models the phone
 *   reading synced history while the desktop is offline. The real cross-device
 *   sync wire for the transcript stays deferred (it is the ADR-gated later wave);
 *   wave 6 proves the local durability and plane separation the wire will later
 *   carry, and crosses no relay or anchor with transcript bytes.
 * - A phone that already holds the finished transcript keeps rendering it once its
 *   host is not `online`, and the ask-gate refuses a new local-source question:
 *   reading is the durable plane, asking is the live-session plane, and they
 *   answer differently (ADR-0079, ADR-0080).
 * - The account-layer ask-gate distinguishes `online` from `offline` and
 *   `unreachable`: both non-online states deny a new question, and they stay
 *   distinct so a client renders the right recovery (ADR-0115 wave 6).
 * - No workspace table ever gains a source row: the only durable table is
 *   `conversations`, and the source content lives there only as the model-facing
 *   text of one tool result, never as a source table or row.
