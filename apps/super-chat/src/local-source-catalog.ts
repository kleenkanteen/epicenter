/**
 * A read-only local source the Super Chat host can read on this machine and
 * offer as one verb (ADR-0115). The desktop composes a source it owns
 * locally (iMessage in the design memo; an injected reader here) into the same
 * {@link ToolCatalog} the agent loop already consumes, so a chat turn can ask a
 * question that reads it and the answer streams back to every attached client.
 *
 * ## The source stays host-owned
 *
 * The source is never reachable over the relay (ADR-0080 decision 2): a remote
 * client sends only a host-owned session command, the host reads the local
 * source, and the tool result rides back inside the sealed session (ADR-0115).
 * There is no per-app endpoint, no route, and no MCP surface over the wire; the
 * source is one local verb behind the same seam as the in-process apps.
 *
 * ## Read-only means a query that writes nothing
 *
 * The verb is a `query`: it runs unattended (no mutation approval, ADR-0044) and
 * writes to no workspace table. The rows it reads never become workspace rows.
 * They enter the transcript only as the model-facing text of one tool result,
 * exactly like any other tool's output, so the durable transcript is the only
 * place source content lands, and only as chat history, never as a source table.
 *
 * ## Injected reader, so the fixture is not baked into production
 *
 * The reader is injected the way the boxed-app spawn command is (`localBooks`):
 * a test passes a fixture, and a later real host passes a Messages reader,
 * without this module or the host learning which, so the source-plane behavior
 * is exercised end to end without scraping Messages.app.
