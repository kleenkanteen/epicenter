/**
 * Bind one {@link SuperChatHost} to the AttachRelay (ADR-0115): the desktop
 * host dials out to the per-user rendezvous, registers as a host endpoint, and
 * forwards the same session it already owns to every attached client. This is a
 * second transport for the host-owned session command seam (ADR-0113), beside
 * the direct loopback server in `server.ts`: both drive the one host through
 * `handleCommand` and re-render every client from `host.snapshot()`, so a
 * remote client and a local one attach to the same session, never their own
 * thread (ADR-0080).
 *
 * ## What crosses the relay
 *
 * The host addresses each attached client endpoint on its own wire frame, never
 * a broadcast: on any host change it sends each client its own snapshot, and on
 * a client's command bytes it drives `handleCommand`. Addressing each client
 * separately is the seam wave 4 seals (the host will seal per device grant, so
 * the relay only ever forwards per-endpoint ciphertext, ADR-0115 clause 5);
 * wave 1 sends the same plaintext snapshot to each, but already per endpoint.
 *
 * The relay reads none of this: the snapshot and the command bytes are the
 * opaque `payload`; only the endpoint envelope (`deviceId`, `attachId`) is the
 * relay's to route.
