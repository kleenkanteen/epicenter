/**
 * tab-manager's device-local inference connection registry (ADR-0059).
 *
 * One shared registry (built once here) that the chat input picker, the engine,
 * and the cross-device banner all read. Hosted is tab-manager's curated catalog
 * (`APP_MODELS`); custom connections and their discovered models live in
 * `chrome.storage.local` (the `createStorageState` adapter), never synced (a key
 * is a secret and a `localhost` URL is meaningless elsewhere, ADR-0004).
