/**
 * The per-tab unified query over one table's slice of the vault mirror: a WHERE filter, a full-text
 * `match`, and a column `sort`, resolved through ONE read-only SQL query to an ordered list of stems.
 *
 * This is the app's read path made coherent (ADR-0065): SQL decides which rows, in what order,
 * matching what text; the grid renders cells from the in-memory map in that order. The default view
 * stays synchronous: when no control is active (`where`, `match`, and `sort` all empty) the query
 * issues no SQL and `orderedStems` is `undefined`, so the grid paints instantly from the in-memory
 * rows in their natural order. SQL runs only once a control is on.
 *
 * The mirror is the query seam (the vault's SQLite projection); `tableName` names which folder's SQL
 * table to query. Both are taken at construction: a tab's table is non-swappable (a table switch
 * remounts TablePane with a fresh query), so there is nothing to re-point at call time. The unit owns
 * its own `$effect`, which Svelte ties to the component that constructs it (the same pattern as
 * `createPressedKeys`), so the caller just writes `const query = createTableQuery(vault.mirror, () =>
 * table.folderName)`.
 *
 * The effect re-runs on the controls (`where`, `match`, `sort`) and on `mirror.version` (bumped after
 * each mirror write or drop). Keying on the version, not the in-memory rows, means the query fires
 * only once the file it reads is fresh, so a data edit can never land a result from the pre-rebuild
 * mirror. Each run debounces, and its cleanup cancels the pending/in-flight query so a newer control
 * value or rebuild never lands a stale result.
