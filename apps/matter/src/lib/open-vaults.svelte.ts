/**
 * The set of open vaults: the tabs.
 *
 * Multi-vault state is split three ways, and this file owns only the durable slice.
 * WHICH vault is active lives in the URL (`/vault/[id]`); the LIVE watcher lives in
 * the route component (construct on mount, dispose on destroy). All that is left is
 * WHICH vault roots are open: a small persisted list of `{ id, root }` that survives
 * relaunch so the tabs come back. The `id` is opaque and URL-safe so the route can carry
 * it; `/vault/[id]` resolves it back to a `root` via {@link get}. The tab LABEL is not
 * stored: it is `basename(root)`, derived where it renders, so there is no cached copy to
 * keep in sync with the path.
 *
 * Persisted to `open-vaults.json` in the app data dir via `tauri-plugin-store`, a plain
 * inspectable file on disk rather than an opaque webview blob: the same disk-is-truth
 * principle as matter's per-vault `matter.json` / `.matter/matter.sqlite`, applied to the
 * app-level tab set. The home is the app data dir, not a vault, because the open SET spans
 * vaults; it is session chrome, not any one vault's data. The store reads async, so the list
 * hydrates once via {@link ensureHydrated}. The `(vaults)` layout `load` awaits that before
 * any route in the group renders, so SvelteKit gates the paint on the real list: the strip
 * shows tabs with no skeleton and no pre-hydration flash, and an id resolves against the real
 * list, never a spurious 404. The framework's `load` owns readiness (it gates the paint);
 * `ensureHydrated` is just the memoized read it awaits, not a `whenReady`/`hydrated` signal
 * the UI has to branch on.
 *
 * Replaces the old `vaultSession` singleton: where that held ONE `current` vault and
 * drove its lifetime, this holds only the list of tabs and the open/close actions.
 * SvelteKit's router owns everything else, so there is no `Map<id, TableHandle>`, no
 * `activeId`, and no manual dispose policy here.
