/**
 * The Vault's SQLite projection: one hidden `<root>/.matter/matter.sqlite` holding one SQL table per
 * folder, named for the folder, so an agent or SQL console can JOIN across the whole vault
 * (`FROM pages JOIN adaptations`). A PROJECTION only — `assess` owns every reference verdict; SQL
 * never resolves references.
 *
 * The mirror is a SINGLE WRITER: a promise chain whose head is the open-time reset and whose every
 * link is one table's rebuild or drop. Ordering is therefore structural, not hand-managed — the reset
 * always precedes the first write, and a folder's drop-on-leave always follows its last write — so
 * there is no per-call "wait for the db" gate, no lost-rebuild race, and no overlap left for SQLite's
 * busy_timeout to untangle (that timeout stays for agent-vs-app contention). `version` bumps once per
 * applied link; the WHERE filter reads it to re-query only once the file it reads is actually fresh.
 *
 * The Vault is its sole owner: it composes one mirror per root, calls {@link syncTable} from each
 * Table's onChange, {@link dropTable} when a folder leaves, and exposes the handle so the per-tab
 * query state can {@link runQuery} it. Desktop-only: it talks to Tauri directly (no platform seam), mirroring
 * {@link createVault} / {@link createTable}.
