/**
 * `/` is the onboarding empty state, and it is only honest when no vault is open. On
 * relaunch the persisted list restores the tab strip, so landing here would show "Open a
 * vault" above a strip that already has tabs. Focus the first open tab instead, so the app
 * reopens to a vault like any tabbed app. The redirect lands on `/vault/[id]`, keeping vault
 * identity in the URL; only the genuine zero-tab case falls through to `+page.svelte`.
 *
 * The persisted list hydrates async, so `ensureHydrated` first, exactly as
 * `vault/[id]/+page.ts` does: a cold relaunch would otherwise read an empty list and fall
 * through to onboarding even when tabs were saved.
