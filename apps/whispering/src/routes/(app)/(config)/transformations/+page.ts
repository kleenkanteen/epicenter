 * Gate the transformations paint on local storage hydration. The table reads

 * `storage.whenLoaded` resolves, so without this gate the "No transformations yet"
 * empty state flashes before transformations load from disk. SvelteKit blocks
 * the route's render until this load resolves; `whenReady` is a single promise,
 * so it resolves once and a later navigation never re-blocks.
 * Same gate as the sibling `recordings/+page.ts`.
