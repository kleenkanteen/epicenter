 * branches on status and never hands a provider SDK a blank key.

 * The credential facade: the one place the app reads and writes provider secrets,
 * the values a user *brings* (ADR-0074). Every consumer reads through the
 * `available | missing` contract instead of pulling a raw string off
 * `deviceConfig`, so a blank key can never reach a provider SDK.
 *
 * ## Today: device-local plaintext, the safe degenerate
 *
 * Whispering has no auth yet, and the server-derived keyring (invariant 1)
 * arrives only with an authenticated session. With no session there is no
 * keyring, so secrets live device-local in plaintext `localStorage` through
 * `deviceConfig`. This is the deliberate degenerate the spec's staged plan calls
 * layer 1 (shared local read, no crypto), not a gap.
 *
 * ## The auth seam: the user-global encrypted vault
 *
 * When auth lands, the session delivers a server-derived per-owner keyring
 * (`HKDF(rootSecret, principalId)` through `@epicenter/encryption`'s `deriveKeyring`).
 * The facade then attaches ONE user-global vault Y.Doc, addressed by an
 * app-agnostic guid (`epicenter:secret-vault`, never a per-app one) so every
 * Epicenter app attaches the same doc and the same owner's key is the same key
 * regardless of which app reads it (invariant 3). It drives that doc through
 * `createEncryptedYkvLww`, calls `activateEncryption(keyring)`, and migrates the
 * device secrets into it. The read contract does not change: a synced key still
 * reads `available | missing`, because the authenticated keyring makes a present
 * key always decryptable. That wave owns the guid constant, the
 * localStorage-to-vault migration, and the relay attachment; the encrypted-KV
 * primitive and the keyring it needs already exist and are tested.
