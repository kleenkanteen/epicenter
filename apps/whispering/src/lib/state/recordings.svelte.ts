/**
 * Reactive recording state backed by Yjs workspace tables.
 *
 * Reads go through a `fromTable` view, a coarse-grained `ReadonlyTableView`:
 * any recording change re-runs every reader (not per-key). Writes delegate to
 * the workspace table; the Yjs observer behind the view picks up local writes,
 * remote CRDT sync, and migration.
 *
 * Audio blob access still goes through BlobStore (blobs are too large for CRDTs).
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { recordings } from '$lib/state/recordings.svelte';
 *
 * const recording = recordings.get(id);
 * const all = recordings.sorted; // newest first
 *
 * recordings.set(recording);
 * recordings.delete(id);
 * ```
