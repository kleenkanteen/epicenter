/**
 * The single source of truth for transcription providers. One entry per
 * provider owns every fact: label, access, models, capabilities, and the
 * deviceConfig/settings key NAMES used to read its config (never the values,
 * which the dispatcher in `operations/transcribe.ts` reads).
 *
 * Pointer-field naming: the suffix names the store. A `*ConfigKey` field
 * holds the name of a `deviceConfig` entry (device-local, never synced); a
 * `*SettingKey` field holds the name of a `settings` entry (synced workspace
 * KV). Dispatchers resolve the pointer against the matching store.
 *
 * Behavior is deliberately not here. The `id -> transcribe` wiring lives as a
 * static table in the dispatcher, where the provider SDKs already load. That
 * keeps this record free of SDK imports so the workspace schema can import
 * `TRANSCRIPTION_SERVICE_IDS` without bundling them. Icons and the UI-facing
 * join live in `./provider-ui.ts` (icons being the one field heavy enough to
 * pollute that import).

 *   - `session`  a signed-in session; the Epicenter        -> Epicenter
 *                deployment you are bonded to is the key
 *   - `onDevice` nothing but the device: an on-device       -> Local
 *                model file, no network
 *
 * `key` and `endpoint` are the matched pair: both hand a `{ baseUrl, apiKey? }` to
 * an external OpenAI-compatible box, differing only in whether the user brings a
 * key (the vendor's compute) or an endpoint (their own box). `session` is the
 * platform relationship: it follows the STAR-vs-SERVICES split (ADR-0068/0069/0070),
 * reaching the Epicenter deployment that also holds your synced data over your
 * session, on that deployment's house key. Hosted deployments meter it (AI credits);
