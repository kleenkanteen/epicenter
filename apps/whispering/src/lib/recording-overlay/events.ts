 * it stays loadable on web (where the overlay never exists) and from the overlay

 * delivery reach (see `DeliveryReach` in operations/delivery), so it is absent
 * here.
 *
 * - `silent-loss`: the recording never started (no mic, denied permission), so
 *   there is no artifact to recover. Loudest, because the user spoke into
 *   nothing.
 * - `transcription`: the recording was captured (a recordings row exists) but

 * (never the live error object) so it can cross the Tauri IPC boundary to the
 * overlay webview; the pill maps it to a terse label via `FAILURE_LABEL`, and the
 * full error detail lives on the recordings row and in the OS notification.
 *
 * The VAD `recording` variant carries two glanceable, orthogonal signals beside
 * the live meter: `speaking` (VAD has latched onto speech, past mere loudness)
 * and `transcribing` (a previous phrase is still transcribing alongside the live
 * session). They are independent: a new utterance can latch while the prior one
 * still transcribes. Both are already-resolved booleans, not the raw VAD state,
 * so every surface renders them identically without re-deriving. Success and
 * failure earn no signal: success is the landing text, and a VAD failure goes to
 * the OS notification and the recordings row, not the pill (ADR-0039).
 *
 * The `polishing` phase is the always-on AI cleanup running between transcribe
 * and delivery (ADR 0052): the pill holds the same spot, showing a "Polishing…"
 * HUD with a single `ship-raw` control to skip the pass and take the raw
 * transcript now. Unlike the other post-capture phases it carries an action.
