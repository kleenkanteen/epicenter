/**
 * Whispering's instance setting: which Epicenter star this install talks to
 * (ADR-0069/0070). The hosted default uses OAuth; a self-hoster overrides the
 * base URL and pastes the token their box minted (ADR-0071).
 *
 * The read/write/clear contract and the hosted-default invariant live in the
 * shared {@link createInstanceSetting}; this file only injects Whispering's
 * storage key and hosted base URL. `globalThis.localStorage` is `undefined`
 * under SSR import, where the handle reports the hosted default and persists
 * nothing.
