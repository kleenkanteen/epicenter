# Whispering Architecture Deep Dive

Whispering uses a clean three-layer architecture that achieves **extensive code sharing** between the desktop app (Tauri) and web app. This is possible because of how we handle platform differences and separate business logic from UI concerns.

**Quick Navigation:** [Service Layer](#service-layer---pure-business-logic--platform-abstraction) | [RPC Layer](#rpc-layer---adding-reactivity-and-state-management) | [Error Handling](#error-handling-with-wellcrafted)

## Workspace Composition

Whispering uses the same workspace composition vocabulary as the rest of the repo, with a Tauri runtime today:

```txt
defineWorkspace()
  -> defineWhispering(defaultTranscriptionService)
    -> openWhisperingBrowser({ auth, nodeId, defaultTranscriptionService })
```

`defineWhispering(defaultTranscriptionService)` in `src/lib/workspace/definition.ts` is the shared model factory. It defines the fixed workspace id, tables, and KV schema with no platform APIs; the platform argument only changes read-side KV defaults.

`openWhisperingBrowser({ auth, nodeId, defaultTranscriptionService })` in `src/lib/whispering/whispering.active.ts` is the shared browser/Tauri runtime opener. It connects once at boot with `toConnection(auth, nodeId)`, layers the recording markdown export, and aliases `storage.whenLoaded` as `whenReady`; settings metadata comes from the workspace's own `kv.keys` / `kv.getDefault` / `kv.reset` (ADR-0093). The `#platform/whispering` leaves choose the platform auth seam, stable node id, and default transcription service.

The rule is the same as Fuji and Honeycrisp:

```txt
create<App>()
  shared isomorphic model

open<App>Browser/open<App>Daemon/open<App>Tauri()
  runtime resources around that model

attach*
  one side-effectful layer
```

## Service Layer - Pure Business Logic + Platform Abstraction

The service layer contains all business logic as **pure functions** with zero UI dependencies. Services don't know about reactive Svelte variables, user settings, or UI state. They only accept explicit parameters and return `Result<T, E>` types for consistent error handling.

The key innovation is **build-time platform resolution** via Node-standard `#platform/*` subpath imports. Each platform-bound service lives in a folder with both implementations as sibling files plus a shared contract; the app's `package.json` `imports` map points each seam at the matching file per build condition:

```
src/lib/services/recorder/
  index.browser.ts    Browser MediaRecorder APIs
  index.tauri.ts      Tauri recorder plugin
  types.ts            Shared contract both impls are annotated with
```

```jsonc
// package.json
{
  "imports": {
    "#platform/recorder": {
      "tauri": "./src/lib/services/recorder/index.tauri.ts",
      "default": "./src/lib/services/recorder/index.browser.ts"
    }
  }
}
```

The Tauri build activates the `tauri` condition; the web build falls through to `default` (browser):

```ts
// vite.config.ts
const isTauri = process.env.TAURI_ENV_PLATFORM !== undefined;
export default defineConfig(async () => ({
  resolve: {
    // The `...defaultClientConditions` spread is load-bearing: custom
    // conditions REPLACE Vite's defaults rather than adding to them.
    ...(isTauri && { conditions: ['tauri', ...defaultClientConditions] }),
  },
}));
```

Consumers (for example the services barrel `src/lib/services/index.ts`) import the bare specifier `from '#platform/recorder'` with **no platform branch at the call site**. Vite resolves `index.tauri.ts` on Tauri builds and `index.browser.ts` on web builds; the off-target file is never resolved, so it is physically absent from the bundle (a build-time guarantee, not Rollup tree-shaking). This makes the web bundle structurally unable to ship Tauri APIs and vice versa: a Tauri-only file imported by shared code fails the web build instead of shipping a broken runtime.

This mechanism is scoped to `#platform/*` only; every other bare import resolves normally. The editor and `tsc` need no `moduleSuffixes` and no per-target tsconfig: bundler `moduleResolution` reads the `imports` field and lands on `default` (browser) for typechecking. Each impl is annotated with the shared contract (`export const x: Contract = ...`, not `satisfies`, so the concrete type stays hidden and the variants stay in lockstep).

Tauri-only exports (Whispering's `tauriOnly` namespace in `src/lib/tauri.tauri.ts`) are imported **directly** by `.tauri.ts` files (`import { tauriOnly } from '$lib/tauri.tauri'`), not through a `#platform/*` seam, since that seam is null on web. Shared code that only needs the platform boolean reaches it through `import { tauri } from '#platform/tauri'` and checks `if (tauri)`.

Services are **testable** (just pass mock parameters), **reusable** (work identically anywhere via the shared contract in `types.ts`), and **maintainable** (no hidden runtime branches).

The codebase distinguishes two kinds of "which implementation" decisions and uses different mechanisms for each. See `docs/articles/20260526T012650-two-switches-build-time-and-runtime.md` for the walkthrough.

## RPC Layer - Adding Reactivity and State Management

The rpc layer is where reactivity gets injected on top of pure services. It wraps service functions with TanStack Query and handles two key responsibilities:

**Runtime Dependency Injection** - Dynamically switching service implementations based on user settings:

```typescript
// From transcription rpc layer
async function transcribeBlob(blob: Blob) {
  const selectedService = settings.value['transcription.selectedTranscriptionService'];

  switch (selectedService) {
    case 'OpenAI':
      return services.transcriptions.openai.transcribe(blob, {
        apiKey: settings.value['apiKeys.openai'],
        model: settings.value['transcription.openai.model'],
      });
    case 'Groq':
      return services.transcriptions.groq.transcribe(blob, {
        apiKey: settings.value['apiKeys.groq'], 
        model: settings.value['transcription.groq.model'],
      });
  }
}
```

**Workspace State** - After migrating to Yjs CRDTs, domain data (recordings, transformations, transformation runs) lives in reactive workspace state modules (`$lib/state/*.svelte.ts`). These use SvelteMap backed by Yjs documents for instant reactivity. No cache invalidation or optimistic updates needed.

The rpc layer's role has narrowed to things that don't fit in CRDTs:

- **External APIs**: Transcription services, LLM completions (`rpc.transcription.*`, `rpc.transformer.*`)
- **Microphone enumeration**: Async device list with loading states (`manualRecorder.enumerateDevices`). Recorder state itself lives in `$lib/state/manual-recorder.svelte.ts` and `$lib/state/vad-recorder.svelte.ts` as `$state`, not queries.
- **Audio blob access**: Too large for Yjs CRDTs, still served via DbService (`rpc.audio.getPlaybackUrl`)

```svelte
<script>
  import { rpc } from '$lib/rpc';
  import { recordings } from '$lib/state/recordings.svelte';

  // Domain data: workspace state (reactive, no queries needed)
  const latestRecording = $derived(recordings.sorted[0]);

  // Audio blob: still needs TanStack Query (too large for CRDTs)
  const audioUrl = createQuery(() => ({
    ...rpc.audio.getPlaybackUrl(() => latestRecording?.id ?? '').options,
    enabled: !!latestRecording?.id,
  }));
</script>
```

This design keeps services pure and platform-agnostic while giving the UI immediate reactivity for domain data and cached access for external resources.

## Error reporting

Services and operations return tagged errors built with `defineErrors` from `wellcrafted/error`. The call site decides what the user should see by calling `report.error`, `report.info`, `report.success`, or `report.loading` from `$lib/report`. The toast and OS notification surfaces are sinks the spine fans out to; the per-event copy is inline at the call site, not a translator function.

```typescript
const { data, error } = await services.recorder.startRecording(...);

if (error) {
  // Default: title is humanized from error.name, description is error.message,
  // a "More details" action opens the raw error.
  report.error({ cause: error });
  return;
}

// Inline override only when context-specific copy or an action helps:
if (error) {
  report.error({
    cause: error,
    title: 'Authentication required',
    action: { label: 'Update API key', onClick: () => goto('/settings') },
  });
  return;
}
```

## Error Handling with WellCrafted

Whispering uses [WellCrafted](https://github.com/wellcrafted-dev/wellcrafted), a lightweight TypeScript library I created to bring Rust-inspired error handling to JavaScript. I built WellCrafted after using the [effect-ts library](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect) when it first came out in 2023. I was very excited about the concepts but found it too verbose. WellCrafted distills my takeaways from effect-ts and makes them better by leaning into more native JavaScript syntax, making it perfect for this use case. Unlike traditional try-catch blocks that hide errors, WellCrafted makes all potential failures explicit in function signatures using the `Result<T, E>` pattern.

`wellcrafted` ensures robust error handling across the entire codebase, from service layer functions to UI components, while maintaining excellent developer experience with TypeScript's control flow analysis.

## Architecture Patterns

- **Service Layer**: Platform-agnostic business logic with Result types
- **RPC Layer**: Reactive data management with caching
- **RPC Pattern**: Unified API interface for non-CRUD operations (`rpc.audio.*`, `rpc.transcription.*`, `rpc.actions.*`)
- **Dependency Injection**: Clean separation of concerns

## Key Architectural Decisions

1. **Pure Functions Over Classes**: Services are functions, not classes, making them easier to test and compose
2. **Explicit Error Handling**: Every function that can fail returns a Result type
3. **Platform Abstraction at Build Time**: Platform detection happens once, not at runtime
4. **Three Clear Layers**: Each layer has a specific responsibility with clear boundaries
5. **TypeScript Throughout**: Full type safety from services to UI components
