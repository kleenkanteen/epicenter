# Honeycrisp

Honeycrisp is a notes app that works offline first and syncs when it can. Notes, folders, and rich text are all Yjs CRDTs. Two devices can edit the same note simultaneously and converge without conflicts. Open two browser tabs and try it.

Part of the [Epicenter](https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter) monorepo. AGPL-3.0 licensed.

## How it works

### Layout

Single-route SvelteKit app with a three-pane layout: sidebar (folders) → note list → editor. SSR is disabled; the app runs entirely in the browser as a static site.

### Data layer

All shared state lives in an Epicenter workspace (`id: "epicenter-honeycrisp"`). The split follows the repo-wide naming pattern:

```txt
honeycrispWorkspace
  shared isomorphic definition: id, tables, actions, notes.body child docs

openHoneycrispBrowser()
  browser runtime: local storage, sync, child-doc storage and sync
```

The Svelte app mounts the browser runtime through `createSession`, so the workspace is only created after a signed-in identity provides `ownerId` and sync transport.

### Rich-text editing

Each note's body is a `Y.XmlFragment` in the `notes.body` child doc declared by `honeycrispWorkspace`. The browser opener attaches storage and sync around child docs, and `NoteBodyPane.svelte` opens the active note body through `honeycrisp.tables.notes.docs.body.open(noteId)`. ProseMirror binds to the fragment via `y-prosemirror`, giving collaborative editing for free. The editor schema covers paragraphs, headings, lists, task lists, underline, and strikethrough. Every ProseMirror transaction extracts a title, preview snippet, and word count for the note row; the child-doc `touch: 'updatedAt'` declaration owns the update timestamp.

### Soft deletion

Notes are never removed from the CRDT. They're soft-deleted with a `deletedAt` timestamp. This matters when two devices diverge: one deletes a note while the other keeps editing it. Without soft deletion, the CRDT has no way to represent "deleted but also modified." With it, you can restore the note and keep the edits. Soft-deleted notes appear in "Recently Deleted" where you can restore or permanently remove them.

### Auth

Google sign-in via `@epicenter/svelte/auth-form`. The session is persisted across reloads. The workspace connects once a signed-in identity is available.

## Workspace schema

**Workspace ID:** `epicenter-honeycrisp`

### Tables

**`folders`**
| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `id` | `FolderId` |
| `name` | `string` |
| `icon` | `string` (optional) |
| `sortOrder` | `number` |

**`notes`**
| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `id` | `NoteId` |
| `folderId` | `FolderId` (optional) |
| `title` | `string` |
| `preview` | `string` |
| `pinned` | `boolean` |
| `createdAt` | `DateTimeString` |
| `updatedAt` | `DateTimeString` |
| `deletedAt` | `DateTimeString` (optional, soft delete) |
| `wordCount` | `number` (optional) |

Each note's body lives in a separate Y.Doc opened by `honeycrisp.tables.notes.docs.body.open(noteId)`. The handle yields a `Y.XmlFragment` that ProseMirror binds to; editor logic refreshes title, preview, and word count on content changes, while the child-doc declaration refreshes `updatedAt`.

Honeycrisp currently has no workspace KV schema. View selection, sorting, and URL state live in the Svelte state layer.

## Other features

- **Pin/unpin**: pinned notes sort to the top of the list.
- **Folder deletion**: re-parents all notes in the folder to unfiled, keeping data intact.
- **Sorting**: by date edited, date created, or title.
- **Search**: filters by title and preview content.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: `Cmd+N` (new note), `Cmd+Shift+N` (new folder).
- **Context menus**: per-note actions: pin, move to folder, delete, restore.

## Development

Prerequisites: [Bun](https://bun.sh).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter.git
cd epicenter
bun install
cd apps/honeycrisp
bun dev
```

This starts the app dev server on port 5175. Auth and sync expect the local API on `localhost:8787`; start it from the repo root with `bun run dev:api`.
